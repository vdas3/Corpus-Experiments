Serene Serenade,Celestial Cantor,"96 ContributorsSong of Myself Lyrics1
I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.
My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death
Creeds and schools in abeyance,
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check with original energy.
2
Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.
The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.
The smoke of my own breath,
Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,
My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,
The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of the wind,
A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,
The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.
Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?
Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.

I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the
Beginning and the end,
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.
Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world.
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.
To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.
Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well
entretied, braced in the beams,
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
I and this mystery here we stand.
Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is
not my soul.
Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.
Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while
they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man
hearty and clean,
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.
I am satisfied — I see, dance, laugh, sing;
As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side
through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day
with stealthy tread,
Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the
house with their plenty,
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and
which is ahead?
4
Trippers and askers surround me,
People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,
The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors
old and new,
My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,
The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or
loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful
news, the fitful events;
These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
But they are not the Me myself.
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,
Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.
Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,
I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.
5
I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.
Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture,
not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your
tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held
my feet.
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the
women my sisters and lovers,
And that a kelson of the creation is love,
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder,
mullein and poke-weed.
6
A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full
Hands,
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any
More than he.
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful
Green stuff woven.
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we
May see and remark, and say Whose?
Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the
Vegetation.
Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow
Zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the
Same, I receive them the same.
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken
Soon out of their mothers' laps,
And here you are the mothers' laps.
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old
Mothers,
Darker than the colourless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths
For nothing.
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men
And women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring
Taken soon out of their laps.
What do you think has become of the young and old men?
And what do you think has become of the women and
Children?
They are alive and well somewhere,
The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at
The end to arrest it,
And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.
All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and
Luckier.
7
Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I
Know it.
I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd
Babe, and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one
Good,
The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all
Good.
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal
And fathomless as myself,
(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)
Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and
Female,
For me those that have been boys and that love women,
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be
Slighted,
For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and
The mothers of mothers,
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
For me children and the begetters of children.
Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot
Be shaken away.
8
The little one sleeps in its cradle,
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away
Flies with my hand.
The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy
Hill,
I peeringly view them from the top.
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the
Pistol has fallen.
The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of
The promenaders,
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb,
The clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,
The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,
The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,
The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the
Hospital,
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly
Working his passage to the centre of the crowd,
The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or
In fits,
What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry
Home and give birth to babes,
What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what
howls restrain'd by decorum,
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,
acceptances, rejections with convex lips,
I mind them or the show or resonance of them — I come and I
depart.
9
The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn
wagon,
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.
I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,
I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and
timothy,
And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.
10
Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,
Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,
Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.
The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle
and scud,
My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously
from the deck.
The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,
I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;
You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far
west, the bride was a red girl,
Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,
On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,
She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.
The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,
And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and
bruis'd feet,
And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,
I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.
11
Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,
Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;
Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.
She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the
window.
Which of the young men does she like the best?
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.
Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.
Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.
The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from
their long hair,
Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.
An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,
It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.
The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge
to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and
bending arch,
They do not think whom they souse with spray.
12
The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his
knife at the stall in the market,
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,
Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great
heat in the fire.
From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive
arms,
Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,
They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.
13
The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block
Swags underneath on its tied-over chain,
The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady
And tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens
Over his hip-band,
His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of
His hat away from his forehead,
The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the
Black of his polish'd and perfect limbs.
I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not
Stop there,
I go with the team also.
In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well
As forward sluing,
To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object
Missing,
Absorbing all to myself and for this song.
Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,
What is that you express in your eyes?
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.
My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my
Distant and day-long ramble,
They rise together, they slowly circle around.
I believe in those wing'd purposes,
And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,
And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not
Something else,
And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills
Pretty well to me,
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.
14
The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,
Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,
The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,
Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.
The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,
The chickadee, the prairie-dog,
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,
The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread
Wings,
I see in them and myself the same old law.
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred
Affections,
They scorn the best I can do to relate them.
I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,
Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes
And mauls, and the drivers of horses,
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.
What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,
Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take
Me,
Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,
Scattering it freely forever.
15
The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,
The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane
Whistles its wild ascending lisp,
The married and unmarried children ride home to their
Thanksgiving dinner,
The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong
Arm,
The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon
Are ready,
The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,
The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,
The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big
Wheel,
The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe
And looks at the oats and rye,
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his
Mother's bedroom;)
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his
Case,
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the
Manuscript;
The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;
The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard
Nods by the bar-room stove,
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his
Beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,
The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him,
Though I do not know him;)
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean
On their rifles, some sit on logs,
Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position,
Levels his piece;
The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,
As the woolly-pates ho in the sugar-field, the overseer views
Them from his saddle,
The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their
Partners, the dancers bow to each other,
The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to
The musical rain,
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,
The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering
Moccasins and bead-bags for sale,
The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with
Half-shut eyes bent sideways,
As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is
Thrown for the shore-going passengers,
The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister
Winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the
Knots,
The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago
Borne her first child,
The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine
Or in the factory or mill,
The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the
Reporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the signpainter
Is lettering with blue and gold,
The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts
At his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers
Follow him,
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,
The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the
White sails sparkle!)
The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,
The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser
Higgling about the odd cent;)
The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the
Clock moves slowly,
The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her
Tipsy and pimpled neck,
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and
Wink to each other,
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)
The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the
Great Secretaries,
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with
Twined arms,
The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in
The hold,
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his
Cattle,
As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by
The jingling of loose change,
The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the
Roof, the masons are calling for mortar,
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the
Laborers;
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is
Gather'd, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes
Of cannon and small arms!)
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the
Mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole
In the frozen surface,
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter
Strikes deep with his axe,
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood
Or pecan-trees,
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through
Those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,
Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or
Altamahaw,
Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and
Great-grandsons around them,
In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers
After their day's sport,
The city sleeps and the country sleeps,
The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband
Sleeps by his wife;
And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.
16
I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff
That is fine,
One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same
And the largest the same,
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant
And hospitable down by the Oconee I live,
A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the
Limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin
Leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,
A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier,
Badger, Buck-eye;
At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with
Fishermen off Newfoundland,
At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and
Tacking,
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine,
Or the Texan ranch,
Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners,
(loving their big proportions,)
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake
Hands and welcome to drink and meat,
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,
A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,
A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,
Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.
I resist any thing better than my own diversity,
Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,
And am not stuck up, and am in my place.
(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,
The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in
Their place,
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)
17
These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands,
They are not original with me,
If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or
Next to nothing,
If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they
Are nothing,
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are
Nothing.
This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the
Water is,
This the common air that bathes the globe.
18
With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches
For conquer'd and slain persons.
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in
Which they are won.
I beat and pound for the dead,
I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for
Them.
Vivas to those who have fail'd!
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome
Heroes!
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest
Heroes known!
19
This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make
Appointments with all,
I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
There shall be no difference between them and the rest.
This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of
Hair,
This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,
This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.
Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica
On the side of a rock has.
Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering
Through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?
This hour I tell things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.
20
Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?
What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
Else it were time lost listening to me.
I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids,
Conformity goes to the fourth-remov'd,
I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.
Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?
Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd
With doctors and calculated close,
I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.
In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.
I know I am solid and sound,
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.
I know I am deathless,
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,
I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt
Stick at night.
I know I am august,
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house
By, after all.)
I exist as I am, that is enough,
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
And if each and all be aware I sit content.
One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is
Myself,
And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or
Ten million years,
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can
Wait.
My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,
I laugh at what you call dissolution,
And I know the amplitude of time.
21
I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are
With me,
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I
Translate into a new tongue.
I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.
I chant the chant of dilation or pride,
We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,
I show that size is only development.
Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and
Still pass on.
I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.
Press close bare-bosom'd night — press close magnetic
Nourishing night!
Night of south winds — night of the large few stars!
Still nodding night — mad naked summer night.
Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
Earth of departed sunset — earth of the mountains misty-topt!
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!
Far-swooping elbow'd earth — rich apple-blossom'd earth!
Smile, for your lover comes.
Prodigal, you have given me love — therefore I to you give
Love!
O unspeakable passionate love.
22
You sea! I resign myself to you also — I guess what you mean,
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,
We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of
Sight of the land,
Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,
Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.
Sea of stretch'd ground-swells,
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,
Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready
Graves,
Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,
I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.
Partaker of influx and efflux, I, extoller of hate and conciliation,
Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.
I am he attesting sympathy,
(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house
That supports them?)
I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the
Poet of wickedness also.
What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand
Indifferent,
My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,
I moisten the roots of all that has grown.
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and
Rectified?
I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,
There is no better than it and now.
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not
Such a wonder,
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean
Man or an infidel.
23
Endless unfolding of words of ages!
And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.
A word of the faith that never balks,
Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time
Absolutely.
It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,
That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.
I accept Reality and dare not question it,
Materialism first and last imbuing.
Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,
This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a
Grammar of the old cartouches,
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown
Seas,
This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a
Mathematician.
Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!
Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,
I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.
Less the reminders of properties told my words,
And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor
men and women fully equipt,
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.
24
Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,
Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.
No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,
No more modest than immodest.
Unscrew the locks from the doors!
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!
Whoever degrades another degrades me,
And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.
Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the
current and index.
I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.
Through me many long dumb voices,
Voices of the interminable generation of prisoners and slaves,
Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,
And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,
And of the rights of them the others are down upon,
Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,
Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.
Through me forbidden voices,
Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,
Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.
I do not press my fingers across my mouth,
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,
Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.
I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.
Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from,
The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,
This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.
If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,
Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!
Sun so generous it shall be you!
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!
Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be you.
I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,
I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of
My faintest wish,
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the
Friendship I take again.
That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the
Metaphysics of books.
To behold the day-break!
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,
The air tastes good to my palate.
Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising,
Freshly exuding,
Scooting obliquely high and low.
Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,
Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.
The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,
The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,
The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!
25
Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill
Me,
If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the
Day-break.
My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes
Of worlds.
Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,
Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?
Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of
Articulation,
Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are
Folded?
Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
I underlying causes to balance them at last,
My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the
Meaning of all things,
Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in
Search of this day.)
My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I
Really am,
Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward
You.
Writing and talk do not prove me,
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.
26
Now I will do nothing but listen,
To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute
Toward it.
I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of
Flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,
I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or
Following,
Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the
Day and night,
Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh
Of work-people at their meals,
The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the
Sick,
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips
Pronouncing a death-sentence,
The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,
The refrain of the anchor-lifters,
The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of
Swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory
Tinkles and color'd lights,
The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching
Cars,
The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching
Two and two,
(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with
Black muslin.)
I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)
I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.
I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
Ah this indeed is music — this suits me.
A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.
I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd
Them,
It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent
Waves,
I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,
Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in
Fakes of death,
At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,
And that we call Being.
27
To be in any form, what is that?
(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back
Thither,)
If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell
Were enough.
Mine is no callous shell,
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.
I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,
To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I
Can stand.
28
Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,
My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is
Hardly different from myself,
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,
Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,
Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and
Pasture-fields,
Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,
They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the
Edges of me,
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my
Anger,
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.
The sentries desert every other part of me,
They have left me helpless to a red marauder,
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against
Me.
I am given up by traitors,
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the
Greatest traitor,
I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me
There.
You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in
Its throat,
Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.
29
Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd
Touch!
Did it make you ache so, leaving me?
Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual
Loan,
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.
Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and
Vital,
Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.
30
All truths wait in all things,
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,
The insignificant is as big to me as any,
(What is less or more than a touch?)
Logic and sermons never convince,
The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.
(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,
Only what nobody denies is so.)
A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for
Each other,
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it
Becomes omnific,
And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.
31
I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of
The stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and
The egg of the wren,
And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,
And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any
Statue,
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of
Infidels.
I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,
Grains, esculent roots,
And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,
And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
But call any thing back again when I desire it.
In vain the speeding or shyness,
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my
Approach,
In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd
Bones,
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
In vain the ocean setting in hollows and the great monsters
Lying low,
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,
I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the
Cliff.
32
I think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid
And self-contain'd,
I stand and look at them long and long.
They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of
Owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands
Of years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.
So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in
Their possession.
I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop
Them?
Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on
Brotherly terms.
A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my
Caresses,
Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly
Moving.
His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around
And return.
I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,
Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.
33
Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,
What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,
What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,
And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the
Morning.
My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,
I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,
I am afoot with my vision.
By the city's quadrangular houses — in log huts, camping
With lumbermen,
Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet
Bed,
Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and
Parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,
Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new
Purchase,
Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down
The shallow river,
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where
The buck turns furiously at the hunter,
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where
The otter is feeding on fish,
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,
Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where
The beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;
Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton
Plant, over the rice in its low moist field,
Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum
And slender shoots from the gutters,
Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over
The delicate blue-flower flax,
Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer
There with the rest,
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the
Breeze;
Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on
By low scragged limbs,
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the
Leaves of the brush,
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the
Wheatlot,
Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great
Gold-bug drops through the dark,
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and
Flows to the meadow,
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous
Shuddering of their hides,
Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons
Straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons
From the rafters;
Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its
Cylinders,
Where the human heart beats with terrible throes under its
Ribs,
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in
It myself and looking composedly down,)
Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat
Hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,
Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,
Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,
Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are
Corrupting below;
Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the
Regiments,
Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my
Countenance,
Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood
Outside,
Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good
Game of base-ball,
At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,
Bull-dances, drinking, laughter,
At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash,
Sucking the juice through a straw,
At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,
At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,
House-raisings;
Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,
Screams, weeps,
Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks
Are scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the
Stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with
Short jerks,
Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and
Lonesome prairie,
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square
Miles far and near,
Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the
Long-lived swan is curving and winding,
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs
Her near-human laugh,
Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid
By the high weeds,
Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground
With their heads out,
Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled
Trees,
Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the
Marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm
Noon,
Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the
Walnut-tree over the wall,
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired
Leaves,
Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,
Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon,
Through the office or public hall;
Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd
With the new and old,
Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,
Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and
Talks melodiously,
Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,
Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist
preacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;
Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole
forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,
Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the
Clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I
In the middle;
Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy,
(behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet,
Or the moccasin print,
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish
Patient,
Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a
Candle;
Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,
Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and flickle as any,
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from
Me a long while,
Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God
By my side,
Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the
Stars,
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and
The diameter of eighty thousand miles,
Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in
Its belly,
Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,
Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,
I tread day and night such roads.
I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,
And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,
My course runs below the soundings of plummets.
I help myself to material and immaterial,
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.
I anchor my ship for a little while only,
My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns
To me.
I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a
Pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.
I ascend to the foretruck,
I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,
We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,
Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the
Wonderful beauty,
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the
Scenery is plain in all directions,
The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out
My fancies toward them,
We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are
Soon to be engaged,
We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass
With still feet and caution,
Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,
The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living
Cities of the globe.
I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,
I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride
Myself,
I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.
My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,
They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.
I understand the large hearts of heroes,
The courage of present times and all times,
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of
The steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,
How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful
Of days and faithful of nights,
And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we
Will not desert you;
How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days
And would not give it up,
How he saved the drifting company at last,
How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated
From the side of their prepared graves,
How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the
Sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;
All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,
I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.
The disdain and calmness of martyrs,
The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry
Wood, her children gazing on,
The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,
Blowing, cover'd with sweat,
The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the
Murderous buckshot and the bullets,
All these I feel or am.
I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the
Marksmen,
I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the
Ooze of my skin,
I fall on the weeds and stones,
The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with
Whip-stocks.
Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself
Become the wounded person,
My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.
I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,
Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,
Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my
Comrades,
I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,
They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.
I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for
My sake,
Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,
White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are
Bared of their fire-caps,
The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.
Distant and dead resuscitate,
They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the
Clock myself.
I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,
I am there again.
Again the long roll of the drummers,
Again the attacking cannon, mortars,
Again to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.
I take part, I see and hear the whole,
The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,
The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,
Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable
Repairs,
The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped
Explosion,
The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously
Waves with his hand,
He gasps through the clot Mind not me — mind
— the entrenchments.
34
Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,
(I tell not the fall of Alamo,
Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,
The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)
'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and
Twelve young men.
Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their
Baggage for breastworks,
Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine
Times their number, was the price they took in advance,
Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,
They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing
And seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners
Of war.
They were the glory of the race of rangers,
Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,
Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and
Affectionate,
Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,
Not a single one over thirty years of age.
The second First-day morning they were brought out in
Squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,
The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by
Eight.
None obey'd the command to kneel,
Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and
Straight,
A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and
Dead lay together,
The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw
Them there,
Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,
These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the
Blunts of muskets.
A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two
More came to release him,
The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.
At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;
That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve
Young men.

Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it
To me.
Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or
Truer, and never was, and never will be;
Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.
We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,
My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.
We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first
Fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.
Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the
Gain, and five feet of water reported,
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the
After-hold to give them a chance for themselves.
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.
Our frigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun
Our part of the fighting.
Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's
Main-mast,
Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry
And clear his decks.
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially
The main-top,
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.
Not a moment's cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the
Powder-magazine.
One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought
We are sinking.
Serene stands the little captain,
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender
To us.
36
Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass
To the one we have conquer'd,
The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders
Through a countenance white as a sheet,
Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and
Carefully curl'd whiskers,
The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and
Below,
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of
Flesh upon the masts and spars,
Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe
Of waves,
Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong
Scent,
A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,
Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields
By the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,
The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,
Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and
Long, dull, tapering groan,
These so, these irretrievable.
37
You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!
Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,
See myself in prison shaped like another man,
And feel the dull unintermitted pain,
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and
Keep watch,
It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.
Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd
To him and walk by his side,
(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with
Sweat on my twitching lips.)
Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am
Tried and sentenced.
Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the
Last gasp,
My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me
People retreat.
Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in
Them,
I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.
38
Enough! enough! enough!
Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!
Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,
Dreams, gaping,
I discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.
That I could forget the mockers and insults!
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the
Bludgeons and hammers!
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion
And bloody crowning!
I remember now,
I resume the overstaid fraction,
The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or
To any graves,
Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.
I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an
Average unending procession,
Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,
Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,
The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of
Years.
Eleves, I salute you! come forward!
Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.
39
The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?
Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?
Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?
Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?
The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?
Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,
They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them,
Stay with them.
Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass,
Uncomb'd head, laughter, and naivetè,
Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and
Emanations,
They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,
They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly
Out of the glance of his eyes.
40
Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask — lie over!
You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.
Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,
Say, old top-knot, what do you want?
Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,
And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,
And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and
Days.
Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,
When I give I give myself.
You there, impotent, loose in the knees,
Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,
Spread your palms and life the flaps of your pockets,
I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to
Spare,
And any thing I have I bestow.
I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,
You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold
You.
To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,
On his right cheek I put the family kiss,
And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.
On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler
Babes,
(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant
Republics.)
To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the
Door,
Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,
Let the physician and the priest go home.
I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,
O despairer, here is my neck,
By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight
Upon me.
I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,
Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,
Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.
Sleep — I and they keep guard all night,
Not doubt, not disease shall dare to lay finger upon you,
I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,
And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell
You is so.
41
I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,
And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.
I heard what was said of the universe,
Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;
It is middling well as far as it goes — but is that all?
Magnifying and applying come I,
Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,
Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,
Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,
Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,
In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the
Crucifix engraved,
With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and
Image,
Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,
Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,
(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise
And fly and sing for themselves,)
Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,
Bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,
Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,
Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves
Driving the mallet and chisel,
Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of
Smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious
As any revelation,
Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less
To me than the gods of the antique wars,
Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,
Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their
White foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;
By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple
Interceding for every person born,
Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty
Angels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,
The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past
And to come,
Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for
His brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;
What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod
About me, and not filling the square rod then,
The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,
Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,
The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to
Be one of the supremes,
The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good
As the best, and be as prodigious;
By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,
Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the
Shadows.
42
A call in the midst of the crowd,
My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.
Come my children,
Come my boys and girls, my women, household and
Intimates,
Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his
Prelude on the reeds within.
Easily written loose-finger'd chords — I feel the thrum of your
Climax and close.
My head slues round on my neck,
Music rolls, but not from the organ,
Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.
Ever the hard unsunk ground,
Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward
Sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,
Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,
Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb,
That breath of itches and thirsts,
Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one
Hides and bring him forth,
Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,
Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.
Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,
To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,
Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once
Going,
Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for
Payment receiving,
A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.
This is the city and I am one of the citizens,
Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars,
Markets, newspapers, schools,
The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,
Stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.
The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and
Tail'd coats,
I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or
Fleas,)
I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and
Shallowest is deathless with me,
What I do and say the same waits for them,
Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in
Them.
I know perfectly well my own egotism,
Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,
And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.
Not words of routine this song of mine,
But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;
This printed and bound book — but the printer and the
Printing-office boy?
The well-taken photographs — but your wife or friend close
And solid in your arms?
The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her
Turrets — but the pluck of the captain and engineers?
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture — but the host
And hostess, and the look out of their eyes?
The sky up there — yet here or next door, or across the way?
The saints and sages in history — but you yourself?
Sermons, creeds, theology — but the fathomless human brain,
And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?
43
I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,
My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,
Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between
Ancient and modern,
Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five
Thousand years,
Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting
The sun,
Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with
Sticks in the circle of obis,
Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,
Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt
And austere in the woods a gymnosophist,
Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas
Admirant, minding the Koran,
Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and
Knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,
Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified,
Knowing assuredly that he is divine,
To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting
Patiently in a pew,
Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like
Till my spirit arouses me,
Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement
And land,
Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk
Like a man leaving charges before a journey.
Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,
Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,
Atheistical,
I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,
Despair and unbelief.
How the flukes splash!
How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts
Of blood!
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,
I take my place among you as much as among any,
The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,
And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all
Precisely the same.
I do not know what is untried and afterward,
But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.
Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,
Not a single one can it fail.
It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,
Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,
Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew
Back and was never seen again,
Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it
With bitterness worse than gall,
Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,
Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish
Koboo call'd the ordure of humanity,
Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to
Slip in,
Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of
The earth,
Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of
Myriads that inhabit them,
Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.
44
It is time to explain myself — let us stand up.
What is known I strip away,
I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.
The clock indicates the moment — but what does eternity
Indicate?
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.
Births have brought us richness and variety,
And other births will bring us richness and variety.
I do not call one greater and one smaller,
That which fills its period and place is equal to any.
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,
My sister?
I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,
All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,
(What have I to do with lamentation?)
I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of
Things to be.
My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,
On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between
The steps,
All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even
There,
I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic
Mist,
And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.
Long I was hugg'd close — long and long.
Immense have been the preparations for me,
Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.
Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful
Boatmen,
For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,
They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.
Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,
My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.
For it the nebula cohered to an orb,
The long slow strata piled to rest it on,
Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,
Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited
It with care.
All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,
Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.
45
O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!
O manhood, balanced, florid and full.
My lovers suffocate me,
Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,
Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to
Me at night,
Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging
And chirping over my head,
Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,
Lighting on every moment of my life,
Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,
Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving
Them to be mine.
Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying
Days!
Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what
Grows after and out of itself,
And the dark hush promulges as much as any.
I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,
And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the
Rim of the farther systems.
Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
Outward and outward and forever outward.
My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,
He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,
And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside
Them.
There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,
If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,
Were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would
Not avail in the long run,
We should surely bring up again where we now stand,
And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.
A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,
Do not hazard the span or make it impatient,
They are but parts, any thing is but a part.
See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,
Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.
My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,
The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,
The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be
There.
46
I know I have the best of time and space, and was never
Measured and never will be measured.
I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)
My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut
From the woods,
No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,
I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,
But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,
My left hand hooking you round the waist,
My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the
Public road.
Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,
You must travel it for yourself.
It is not far, it is within reach,
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not
Know,
Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.
Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us
Hasten forth,
Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.
If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your
Hand on my hip,
And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,
For after we start we never lie by again.
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the
Crowded heaven,
And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those
Orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in
Them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?
And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and
Continue beyond.
You are also asking me questions and I hear you,
I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.
Sit a while dear son,
Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,
But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,
I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your
Egress hence.
Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,
Now I wash the gum from your eyes,
You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of
Every moment of your life.
Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,
Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,
To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,
Shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.
47
I am the teacher of athletes,
He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves
The width of my own,
He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the
Teacher.
The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived
Power, but in his own right,
Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,
Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,
Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp
Steel cuts,
First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff,
To sing a song or play on the banjo,
Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with
Small-pox over all latherers,
And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.
I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?
I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,
My words itch at your ears till you understand them.
I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time
While I wait for a boat,
(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of
You,
Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)
I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a
House,
And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or
Her who privately stays with me in the open air.
If you would understand me go to the heights or
Water-shore,
The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of
Waves a key,
The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.
No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,
But roughs and little children better than they.
The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take
Me with him all day,
The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound
Of my voice,
In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and
Seamen and love them.
The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,
On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do
Not fail them,
On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know
Me seek me.
My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in
His blanket,
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
The young mother and old mother comprehend me,
The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget
Where they are,
They and all would resume what I have told them.
48
I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his
Own funeral drest in his shroud,
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of
The earth,
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod
Confounds the learning of all times,
And there is no trade or employment but the young man
Following it may become a hero,
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the
Wheel'd universe,
And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool
And composed before a million universes.
And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
For I who am curious about each am not curious about
God,
(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about
God and about death.)
I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God
Not in the least,
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than
Myself.
Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and
Each moment then,
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own
Face in the glass,
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is
Sign'd by God's name,
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er
I go,
Others will punctually come for ever and ever.
49
And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is
Idle to try to alarm me.
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,
I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,
And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that
Does not offend me,
I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,
I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of
Melons.
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many
Deaths,
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,
O suns — O grass of graves — O perpetual transfers and
Promotions,
If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing
Twilight,
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk — toss on the black stems that
Decay in the muck,
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.
I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,
I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams
Reflected,
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring
Great or small.
50
There is that in me — I do not know what it is — but I know it
Is in me.
Wrench'd and sweaty — calm and cool then my body becomes,
I sleep — I sleep long.
I do not know it — it is without name — it is a word unsaid,
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.
Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers
And sisters.
Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
It is not chaos or death — it is form, union, plan — it is eternal
Life — it is Happiness.
51
The past and present wilt — I have fill'd them, emptied them,
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a
Minute longer.)
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.
Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through
With his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too
Late?
52
The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains
Of my gab and my loitering.
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the
Shadow'd wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you.57Embed"

Unsaved,Cean Joseph,"12 ContributorsChapter 11: Robber Barons And Rebels LyricsIn the year 1877, the signals were given for the rest of the century: the blacks would be put back; the strikes of white workers would not be tolerated; the industrial and political elites of North and South would take hold of the country and organize the greatest march of economic growth in human history. They would do it with the aid of, and at the expense of, black labor, white labor, Chinese labor, European immigrant labor, female labor, rewarding them differently by race, sex, national origin, and social class, in such a way as to create separate levels of oppression-a skillful terracing to stabilize the pyramid of wealth.
Between the Civil War and 1900, steam and electricity replaced human muscle, iron replaced wood, and steel replaced iron (before the Bessemer process, iron was hardened into steel at the rate of 3 to 5 tons a day; now the same amount could be processed in 15 minutes). Machines could now drive steel tools. Oil could lubricate machines and light homes, streets, factories. People and goods could move by railroad, propelled by steam along steel rails; by 1900 there were 193,000 miles of railroad. The telephone, the typewriter, and the adding machine speeded up the work of business.
Machines changed farming. Before the Civil War it took 61 hours of labor to produce an acre of wheat. By 1900, it took 3 hours, 19 minutes. Manufactured ice enabled the transport of food over long distances, and the industry of meatpacking was born.
Steam drove textile mill spindles; it drove sewing machines. It came from coal. Pneumatic drills now drilled deeper into the earth for coal. In 1860, 14 million tons of coal were mined; by 1884 it was 100 million tons. More coal meant more steel, because coal furnaces converted iron into steel; by 1880 a million tons of steel were being produced; by 1910, 25 million tons. By now electricity was beginning to replace steam. Electrical wire needed copper, of which 30,000 tons were produced in 1880; 500,000 tons by 1910.
To accomplish all this required ingenious inventors of new processes and new machines, clever organizers and administrators of the new corporations, a country rich with land and minerals, and a huge supply of human beings to do the back-breaking, unhealthful, and dangerous work. Immigrants would come from Europe and China, to make the new labor force. Farmers unable to buy the new machinery or pay the new railroad rates would move to the cities. Between 1860 and 1914, New York grew from 850,000 to 4 million, Chicago from 110,000 to 2 million, Philadelphia from 650,000 to 1 1/2 million.
In some cases the inventor himself became the organizer of businesses-like Thomas Edison, inventor of electrical devices. In other cases, the businessman compiled other people's inventions, like Gustavus Swift, a Chicago butcher who put together the ice-cooled railway car with the ice- cooled warehouse to make the first national meatpacking company in 1885. James Duke used a new cigarette-rolling machine that could roll, paste, and cut tubes of tobacco into 100,000 cigarettes a day; in 1890 he combined the four biggest cigarette producers to form the American Tobacco Company.
While some multimillionaires started in poverty, most did not. A study of the origins of 303 textile, railroad, and steel executives of the 1870s showed that 90 percent came from middle- or upper-class families. The Horatio Alger stories of ""rags to riches"" were true for a few men, but mostly a myth, and a useful myth for control.
Most of the fortune building was done legally, with the collaboration of the government and the courts. Sometimes the collaboration had to be paid for. Thomas Edison promised New Jersey politicians $1,000 each in return for favorable legislation. Daniel Drew and Jay Gould spent $1 million to bribe the New York legislature to legalize their issue of $8 million in ""watered stock"" (stock not representing real value) on the Erie Railroad.
The first transcontinental railroad was built with blood, sweat, politics and thievery, out of the meeting of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads. The Central Pacific started on the West Coast going east; it spent $200,000 in Washington on bribes to get 9 million acres of free land and $24 million in bonds, and paid $79 million, an overpayment of $36 million, to a construction company which really was its own. The construction was done by three thousand Irish and ten thousand Chinese, over a period of four years, working for one or two dollars a day.
The Union Pacific started in Nebraska going west. It had been given 12 million acres of free land and $27 million in government bonds. It created the Credit Mobilier company and gave them $94 million for construction when the actual cost was $44 million. Shares were sold cheaply to Congressmen to prevent investigation. This was at the suggestion of Massachusetts Congressman Oakes Ames, a shovel manufacturer and director of Credit Mobilier, who said: ""There is no difficulty in getting men to look after their own property."" The Union Pacific used twenty thousand workers-war veterans and Irish immigrants, who laid 5 miles of track a day and died by the hundreds in the heat, the cold, and the battles with Indians opposing the invasion of their territory.
Both railroads used longer, twisting routes to get subsidies from towns they went through. In 1869, amid music and speeches, the two crooked lines met in Utah.
The wild fraud on the railroads led to more control of railroad finances by bankers, who wanted more stability-profit by law rather than by theft. By the 1890s, most of the country's railway mileage was concentrated in six huge systems. Four of these were completely or partially controlled by the House of Morgan, and two others by the bankers Kuhn, Loeb, and Company.
J. P. Morgan had started before the war, as the son of a banker who began selling stocks for the railroads for good commissions. During the Civil War he bought five thousand rifles for $3.50 each from an army arsenal, and sold them to a general in the field for $22 each. The rifles were defective and would shoot off the thumbs of the soldiers using them. A congressional committee noted this in the small print of an obscure report, but a federal judge upheld the deal as the fulfillment of a valid legal contract.
Morgan had escaped military service in the Civil War by paying $300 to a substitute. So did John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Philip Armour, Jay Gould, and James Mellon. Mellon's father had written to him that ""a man may be a patriot without risking his own life or sacrificing his health. There are plenty of lives less valuable.""
It was the firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company that was given a U.S. government contract to float a bond issue of $260 million. The government could have sold the bonds directly; it chose to pay the bankers $5 million in commission.
On January 2, 1889, as Gustavus Myers reports:
... a circular marked ""Private and Confidential"" was issued by the three banking houses of Drexel, Morgan & Company, Brown Brothers & Company, and Kidder, Peabody & Company. The most painstaking care was exercised that this document should not find its way into the press or otherwise become public.... Why this fear? Because the circular was an invitation ... to the great railroad magnates to assemble at Morgan's house, No. 219 Madison Avenue, there to form, in the phrase of the day, an iron-clad combination. ... a compact which would efface competition among certain railroads, and unite those interests in an agreement by which the people of the United States would be bled even more effectively than before.
There was a human cost to this exciting story of financial ingenuity. That year, 1889, records of the Interstate Commerce Commission showed that 22,000 railroad workers were killed or injured.
In 1895 the gold reserve of the United States was depleted, while twenty-six New York City banks had $129 million in gold in their vaults. A syndicate of bankers headed by J. P. Morgan & Company, August Belmont & Company, the National City Bank, and others offered to give the government gold in exchange for bonds. President Grover Cleveland agreed. The bankers immediately resold the bonds at higher prices, making $18 million profit.
A journalist wrote: ""If a man wants to buy beef, he must go to the butcher.... If Mr. Cleveland wants much gold, he must go to the big banker.""
While making his fortune, Morgan brought rationality and organization to the national economy. He kept the system stable. He said: ""We do not want financial convulsions and have one thing one day and another thing another day."" He linked railroads to one another, all of them to banks, banks to insurance companies. By 1900, he controlled 100,000 miles of railroad, half the country's mileage.
Three insurance companies dominated by the Morgan group had a billion dollars in assets. They had $50 million a year to invest-money given by ordinary people for their insurance policies. Louis Brandeis, describing this in his book Other People's Money (before he became a Supreme Court justice), wrote: ""They control the people through the people's own money.""
John D. Rockefeller started as a bookkeeper in Cleveland, became a merchant, accumulated money, and decided that, in the new industry of oil, who controlled the oil refineries controlled the industry. He bought his first oil refinery in 1862, and by 1870 set up Standard Oil Company of Ohio, made secret agreements with railroads to ship his oil with them if they gave him rebates- discounts-on their prices, and thus drove competitors out of business.
One independent refiner said: ""If we did not sell out.... we would be crushed out.. .. There was only one buyer on the market and we had to sell at their terms."" Memos like this one passed among Standard Oil officials: ""Wilkerson & Co. received car of oil Monday 13th... . Please turn another screw."" A rival refinery in Buffalo was rocked by a small explosion arranged by Standard Oil officials with the refinery's chief mechanic.
The Standard Oil Company, by 1899, was a holding company which controlled the stock of many other companies. The capital was $110 million, the profit was $45 million a year, and John D. Rockefeller's fortune was estimated at $200 million. Before long he would move into iron, copper, coal, shipping, and banking (Chase Manhattan Bank). Profits would be $81 million a year, and the Rockefeller fortune would total two billion dollars.
Andrew Carnegie was a telegraph clerk at seventeen, then secretary to the head of the Pennsylvania Railroad, then broker in Wall Street selling railroad bonds for huge commissions, and was soon a millionaire. He went to London in 1872, saw the new Bessemer method of producing steel, and returned to the United States to build a million-dollar steel plant. Foreign competition was kept out by a high tariff conveniently set by Congress, and by 1880 Carnegie was producing 10,000 tons of steel a month, making $1 1/2 million a year in profit. By 1900 he was making $40 million a year, and that year, at a dinner party, he agreed to sell his steel company to J. P. Morgan. He scribbled the price on a note: $492,000,000.
Morgan then formed the U.S. Steel Corporation, combining Carnegie's corporation with others. He sold stocks and bonds for $1,300,000,000 (about 400 million more than the combined worth of the companies) and took a fee of 150 million for arranging the consolidation. How could dividends be paid to all those stockholders and bondholders? By making sure Congress passed tariffs keeping out foreign steel; by closing off competition and maintaining the price at $28 a ton; and by working 200,000 men twelve hours a day for wages that barely kept their families alive.
And so it went, in industry after industry-shrewd, efficient businessmen building empires, choking out competition, maintaining high prices, keeping wages low, using government subsidies. These industries were the first beneficiaries of the ""welfare state."" By the turn of the century, American Telephone and telegraph had a monopoly of the nation's telephone system, International Harvester made 85 percent of all farm machinery, and in every other industry resources became concentrated, controlled. The banks had interests in so many of these monopolies as to create an interlocking network of powerful corporation directors, each of whom sat on the boards of many other corporations. According to a Senate report of the early twentieth century, Morgan at his peak sat on the board of forty-eight corporations; Rockefeller, thirty-seven corporations.
Meanwhile, the government of the United States was behaving almost exactly as Karl Marx described a capitalist state: pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich. Not that the rich agreed among themselves; they had disputes over policies. But the purpose of the state was to settle upper-class disputes peacefully, control lower-class rebellion, and adopt policies that would further the long-range stability of the system. The arrangement between Democrats and Republicans to elect Rutherford Hayes in 1877 set the tone. Whether Democrats or Republicans won, national policy would not change in any important way.
When Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, ran for President in 1884, the general impression in the country was that he opposed the power of monopolies and corporations, and that the Republican party, whose candidate was James Blaine, stood for the wealthy. But when Cleveland defeated Blaine, Jay Gould wired him: ""I feel ... that the vast business interests of the country will be entirely safe in your hands."" And he was right.
One of Cleveland's chief advisers was William Whitney, a millionaire and corporation lawyer, who married into the Standard Oil fortune and was appointed Secretary of the Navy by Cleveland. He immediately set about to create a ""steel navy,"" buying the steel at artificially high prices from Carnegie's plants. Cleveland himself assured industrialists that his election should not frighten them: ""No harm shall come to any business interest as the result of administrative policy so long as I am President ... a transfer of executive control from one party to another does not mean any serious disturbance of existing conditions.""
The presidential election itself had avoided real issues; there was no clear understanding of which interests would gain and which would lose if certain policies were adopted. It took the usual form of election campaigns, concealing the basic similarity of the parties by dwelling on personalities, gossip, trivialities. Henry Adams, an astute literary commentator on that era, wrote to a friend about the election:
We are here plunged in politics funnier than words can express. Very great issues are involved.. . . But the amusing thing is that no one talks about real interests. By common consent they agree to let these alone. We are afraid to discuss them. Instead of this the press is engaged in a most amusing dispute whether Mr. Cleveland had an illegitimate child and did or did not live with more than one mistress.
In 1887, with a huge surplus in the treasury, Cleveland vetoed a bill appropriating $100,000 to give relief to Texas farmers to help them buy seed grain during a drought. He said: ""Federal aid in such cases .. . encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character."" But that same year, Cleveland used his gold surplus to pay off wealthy bondholders at $28 above the $100 value of each bond-a gift of $45 million.
The chief reform of the Cleveland administration gives away the secret of reform legislation in America. The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 was supposed to regulate the railroads on behalf of the consumers. But Richard Olney, a lawyer for the Boston & Maine and other railroads, and soon to be Cleveland's Attorney General, told railroad officials who complained about the Interstate Commerce Commission that it would not be wise to abolish the Commission ""from a railroad point of view."" He explained:
The Commission ... is or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. . . . The part of wisdom is not to destroy the Commission, but to utilize it.
Cleveland himself, in his 1887 State of the Union message, had made a similar point, adding a warning: ""Opportunity for safe, careful, and deliberate reform is now offered; and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people . . . may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs.""
Republican Benjamin Harrison, who succeeded Cleveland as President from 1889 to 1893, was described by Matthew Josephson, in his colorful study of the post-Civil War years, The Politicos: ""Benjamin Harrison had the exclusive distinction of having served the railway corporations in the dual capacity of lawyer and soldier. He prosecuted the strikers  in the federal courts . .. and he also organized and commanded a company of soldiers during the strike. ...""
Harrison's term also saw a gesture toward reform. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act, passed in 1890, called itself ""An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints"" and made it illegal to form a ""combination or conspiracy"" to restrain trade in interstate or foreign commerce. Senator John Sherman, author of the Act, explained the need to conciliate the critics of monopoly: ""They had monopolies ... of old, but never before such giants as in our day. You must heed their appeal or be ready for the socialist, the communist, the nihilist. Society is now disturbed by forces never felt before. . . .""
When Cleveland was elected President again in 1892, Andrew Carnegie, in Europe, received a letter from the manager of his steel plants, Henry Clay Frick: ""I am very sorry for President Harrison, but I cannot see that our interests are going to be affected one way or the other by the change in administration."" Cleveland, facing the agitation in the country caused by the panic and depression of 1893, used troops to break up ""Coxey's Army,"" a demonstration of unemployed men who had come to Washington, and again to break up the national strike on the railroads the following year.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, despite its look of somber, black-robed fairness, was doing its bit for the ruling elite. How could it be independent, with its members chosen by the President and ratified by the Senate? How could it be neutral between rich and poor when its members were often former wealthy lawyers, and almost always came from the upper class? Early in the nineteenth century the Court laid the legal basis for a nationally regulated economy by establishing federal control over interstate commerce, and the legal basis for corporate capitalism by making the contract sacred.
In 1895 the Court interpreted the Sherman Act so as to make it harmless. It said a monopoly of sugar refining was a monopoly in manufacturing, not commerce, and so could not be regulated by Congress through the Sherman Act (U.S. v. E. C. Knight Co.). The Court also said the Sherman Act could be used against interstate strikes (the railway strike of 1894) because they were in restraint of trade. It also declared unconstitutional a small attempt by Congress to tax high incomes at a higher rate (Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Company). In later years it would refuse to break up the Standard Oil and American Tobacco monopolies, saying the Sherman Act barred only ""unreasonable"" combinations in restraint of trade.
A New York banker toasted the Supreme Court in 1895: ""I give you, gentlemen, the Supreme Court of the United States-guardian of the dollar, defender of private property, enemy of spoliation, sheet anchor of the Republic.""
Very soon after the Fourteenth Amendment became law, the Supreme Court began to demolish it as a protection for blacks, and to develop it as a protection for corporations. However, in 1877, a Supreme Court decision (Munn v. Illinois) approved state laws regulating the prices charged to farmers for the use of grain elevators. The grain elevator company argued it was a person being deprived of property, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment's declaration ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."" The Supreme Court disagreed, saying that grain elevators were not simply private property but were invested with ""a public interest"" and so could be regulated.
One year after that decision, the American Bar Association, organized by lawyers accustomed to serving the wealthy, began a national campaign of education to reverse the Court decision. Its presidents said, at different times: ""If trusts are a defensive weapon of property interests against the communistic trend, they are desirable."" And: ""Monopoly is often a necessity and an advantage.""
By 1886, they succeeded. State legislatures, under the pressure of aroused farmers, had passed laws to regulate the rates charged farmers by the railroads. The Supreme Court that year (Wabash v. Illinois) said states could not do this, that this was an intrusion on federal power. That year alone, the Court did away with 230 state laws that had been passed to regulate corporations.
By this time the Supreme Court had accepted the argument that corporations were ""persons"" and their money was property protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Supposedly, the Amendment had been passed to protect Negro rights, but of the Fourteenth Amendment cases brought before the Supreme Court between 1890 and 1910, nineteen dealt with the Negro, 288 dealt with corporations.
The justices of the Supreme Court were not simply interpreters of the Constitution. They were men of certain backgrounds, of certain interests. One of them (Justice Samuel Miller) had said in 1875: ""It is vain to contend with Judges who have been at the bar the advocates for forty years of railroad companies, and all forms of associated capital. . . ."" In 1893, Supreme Court Justice David J. Brewer, addressing the New York State Bar Association, said:
It is the unvarying law that the wealth of the community will be in the hands of the few. . . . The great majority of men are unwilling to endure that long self-denial and saving which makes accumulations possible . .. and hence it always has been, and until human nature is remodeled always will be true, that the wealth of a nation is in the hands of a few, while the many subsist upon the proceeds of their daily toil.
This was not just a whim of the 1880s and 1890s-it went back to the Founding Fathers, who had learned their law in the era of Blackstone's Commentaries, which said: ""So great is the regard of the law for private property, that it will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the common good of the whole community.""
Control in modern times requires more than force, more than law. It requires that a population dangerously concentrated in cities and factories, whose lives are filled with cause for rebellion, be taught that all is right as it is. And so, the schools, the churches, the popular literature taught that to be rich was a sign of superiority, to be poor a sign of personal failure, and that the only way upward for a poor person was to climb into the ranks of the rich by extraordinary effort and extraordinary luck.
In those years after the Civil War, a man named Russell Conwell, a graduate of Yale Law School, a minister, and author of best-selling books, gave the same lecture, ""Acres of Diamonds,"" more than five thousand times to audiences across the country, reaching several million people in all. His message was that anyone could get rich if he tried hard enough, that everywhere, if people looked closely enough, were ""acres of diamonds."" A sampling:
I say that you ought to get rich, and it is your duty to get rich.... The men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community. Let me say here clearly .. . ninety-eight out of one hundred of the rich men of America are honest. That is why they are rich. That is why they are trusted with money. That is why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them. It is because they are honest men. ...
... I sympathize with the poor, but the number of poor who are to be sympathised with is very small. To sympathize with a man whom God has punished for his sins ... is to do wrong.... let us remember there is not a poor person in the United States who was not made poor by his own shortcomings. ...
Conwell was a founder of Temple University. Rockefeller was a donor to colleges all over the country and helped found the University of Chicago. Huntington, of the Central Pacific, gave money to two Negro colleges, Hampton Institute and Tuskegee Institute. Carnegie gave money to colleges and to libraries. Johns Hopkins was founded by a millionaire merchant, and millionaires Cornelius Vanderbilt, Ezra Cornell, James Duke, and Leland Stanford created universities in their own names.
The rich, giving part of their enormous earnings in this way, became known as philanthropists. These educational institutions did not encourage dissent; they trained the middlemen in the American system-the teachers, doctors, lawyers, administrators, engineers, technicians, politicians- those who would be paid to keep the system going, to be loyal buffers against trouble.
In the meantime, the spread of public school education enabled the learning of writing, reading, and arithmetic for a whole generation of workers, skilled and semiskilled, who would be the literate or force of the new industrial age. It was important that these people learn obedience to authority. A journalist observer of the schools in the 1890s wrote: ""The unkindly spirit of the teacher is strikingly apparent; the pupils, being completely subjugated to her will, are silent and motionless, the spiritual atmosphere of the classroom is damp and chilly.""
Back in 1859, the desire of mill owners in the town of Lowell that their workers be educated was explained by the secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education:
The owners of factories are more concerned than other classes and interests in the intelligence of their laborers. When the latter are well-educated and the former are disposed to deal justly, controversies and strikes can never occur, nor can the minds of the masses be prejudiced by demagogues and controlled by temporary and factious considerations.
Joel Spring, in his book Education and the Rise of the Corporate State, says: ""The development of a factory-like system in the nineteenth-century schoolroom was not accidental.""
This continued into the twentieth century, when William Bagley's Classroom Management became a standard teacher training text, reprinted thirty times. Bagley said: ""One who studies educational theory aright can see in the mechanical routine of the classroom the educative forces that are slowly transforming the child from a little savage into a creature of law and order, fit for the life of civilized society.""
It was in the middle and late nineteenth century that high schools developed as aids to the industrial system, that history was widely required in the curriculum to foster patriotism. Loyalty oaths, teacher certification, and the requirement of citizenship were introduced to control both the educational and the political quality of teachers. Also, in the latter part of the century, school officials-not teachers-were given control over textbooks. Laws passed by the states barred certain kinds of textbooks. Idaho and Montana, for instance, forbade textbooks propagating ""political"" doctrines, and the Dakota territory ruled that school libraries could not have ""partisan political pamphlets or books.""
Against this gigantic organization of knowledge and education for orthodoxy and obedience, there arose a literature of dissent and protest, which had to make its way from reader to reader against great obstacles. Henry George, a self-educated workingman from a poor Philadelphia family, who became a newspaperman and an economist, wrote a book that was published in 1879 and sold millions of copies, not only in the United States, but all over the world. His book Progress and Poverty argued that the basis of wealth was land, that this was becoming monopolized, and that a single tax on land, abolishing all others, would bring enough revenue to solve the problem of poverty and equalize wealth in the nation. Readers may not have been persuaded of his solutions, but they could see in their own lives the accuracy of his observations:
It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average of comfort, leisure and refinement has been raised; but these gains are not general. In them the lowest class do not share... This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times. ... There is a vague but general feeling of disappointment; an increased bitterness among the working classes; a widespread feeling of unrest and brooding revolution.. . . The civilized world is trembling on the verge of a great movement. Either it must be a leap upward, which will open the way to advances yet undreamed of, or it must he a plunge downward which will carry us back toward barbarism. ...
A different kind of challenge to the economic and social system was given by Edward Bellamy, a lawyer and writer from western Massachusetts, who wrote, in simple, intriguing language, a novel called Looking Backward, in which the author fells asleep and wakes up in the year 2000, to find a socialistic society in which people work and live cooperatively. Looking Backward, which described socialism vividly, lovingly, sold a million copies in a few years, and over a hundred groups were organized around the country to try to make the dream come true.
It seemed that despite the strenuous efforts of government, business, the church, the schools, to control their thinking, millions of Americans were ready to consider harsh criticism of the existing system, to contemplate other possible ways of living. They were helped in this by the great movements of workers and farmers that swept the country in the 1880s and 1890s. These movements went beyond the scattered strikes and tenants' struggles of the period 1830-1877. They were nationwide movements, more threatening than before to the ruling elite, more dangerously suggestive. It was a time when revolutionary organizations existed in major American cities, and revolutionary talk was in the air.
In the 1880s and 1890s, immigrants were pouring in from Europe at a faster rate than before. They all went through the harrowing ocean voyage of the poor. Now there were not so many Irish and German immigrants as Italians, Russians, Jews, Greeks-people from Southern and Eastern Europe, even more alien to native-born Anglo-Saxons than the earlier newcomers.
How the immigration of different ethnic groups contributed to the fragmentation of the working class, how conflicts developed among groups facing the same difficult conditions, is shown in an article in a Bohemian newspaper, Svornost, of February 27, 1880. A petition of 258 parents and guardians at the Throop School in New York, signed by over half the taxpayers of the school district, said ""the petitioners have just as much right to request the teaching of Bohemian as have the German citizens to have German taught in the public schools.... In opposition to this, Mr. Vocke claims that there is a great deal of difference between Germans and Bohemians, or in other words, they are superior.""
The Irish, still recalling the hatred against them when they arrived, began to get jobs with the new political machines that wanted their vote. Those who became policemen encountered the new Jewish immigrants. On July 30, 1902, New York's Jewish community held a mass funeral for an important rabbi, and a riot took place, led by Irish who resented Jews coming into their neighborhood. The police force was dominantly Irish, and the official investigation of the riot indicated the police helped the rioters: "". .. it appears that charges of unprovoked and most brutal clubbing have been made against policemen, with the result that they were reprimanded or fined a day's pay and were yet retained upon the force.""
There was desperate economic competition among the newcomers. By 1880, Chinese immigrants, brought in by the railroads to do the backbreaking labor at pitiful wages, numbered 75,000 in California, almost one-tenth of the population. They became the objects of continuous violence. The novelist Bret Harte wrote an obituary for a Chinese man named Wan Lee:
Dead, my revered friends, dead. Stoned to death in the streets of San Francisco, in the year of grace 1869 by a mob of halfgrown boys and Christian school children.
In Rock Springs, Wyoming, in the summer of 1885, whites attacked five hundred Chinese miners, massacring twenty-eight of them in cold blood.
The new immigrants became laborers, housepainters, stonecutters, ditchdiggers. They were often imported en masse by contractors. One Italian man, told he was going to Connecticut to work on the railroad, was taken instead to sulfate mines in the South, where he and his fellows were watched over by armed guards in their barracks and in the mines, given only enough money to pay for their railroad fare and tools, and very little to eat. He and others decided to escape. They were captured at gunpoint, ordered to work or die; they still refused and were brought before a judge, put in manacles, and, five months after their arrival, finally dismissed. ""My comrades took the train for New York. I had only one dollar, and with this, not knowing either the country or the language, I had to walk to New York. After forty-two days I arrived in the city utterly exhausted.""
Their conditions led sometimes to rebellion. A contemporary observer told how ""some Italians who worked in a locality near Deal Lake, New Jersey, failing to receive their wages, captured the contractor and shut him up in the shanty, where he remained a prisoner until the county sheriff came with a posse to his rescue.""
A traffic in immigrant child laborers developed, either by contract with desperate parents in the home country or by kidnapping. The children were then supervised by ""padrones"" in a form of slavery, sometimes sent out as beggar musicians. Droves of them roamed the streets of New York and Philadelphia.
As the immigrants became naturalized citizens, they were brought into the American two-party system, invited to be loyal to one party or the other, their political energy thus siphoned into elections. An article in L'ltalia, in November 1894, called for Italians to support the Republican party:
When American citizens of foreign birth refuse to ally themselves with the Republican Party, they make war upon their own welfare. The Republican Party stands for all that the people fight for in the Old World. It is the champion of freedom, progress, order, and law. It is the steadfast foe of monarchial class role.
There were 5 1/2 million immigrants in the 1880s, 4 million in the 1890s, creating a labor surplus that kept wages down. The immigrants were more controllable, more helpless than native workers; they were culturally displaced, at odds with one another, therefore useful as strikebreakers. Often their children worked, intensifying the problem of an oversized labor force and joblessness; in 1880 there were 1,118,000 children under sixteen (one out of six) at work in the United States. With everyone working long hours, families often became strangers to one another. A pants presser named Morris Rosenfeld wrote a poem, ""My Boy,"" which became widely reprinted and recited:
I have a little boy at home,
A pretty little son;
I think sometimes the world is mine
In him, my only one. . . .
'Ere dawn my labor drives me forth;
Tis night when I am free;
A stranger am I to my child;
And stranger my child to me. ...
Women immigrants became servants, prostitutes, housewives, factory workers, and sometimes rebels. Leonora Barry was born in Ireland and brought to the United States. She got married, and when her husband died she went to work in a hosiery mill in upstate New York to support three young children, earning 65 cents her first week. She joined the Knights of Labor, which had fifty thousand women members in 192 women's assemblies by 1886. She became ""master workman"" of her assembly of 927 women, and was appointed to work for the Knights as a general investigator, to ""go forth and educate her sister working-women and the public generally as to their needs and necessities."" She described the biggest problem of women workers: ""Through long years of endurance they have acquired, as a sort of second nature, the habit of submission and acceptance without question of any terms offered them, with the pessimistic view of life in which they see no hope."" Her report for the year 1888 showed: 537 requests to help women organize, 100 cities and towns visited, 1,900 leaflets distributed.
In 1884, women's assemblies of textile workers and hatmakers went on strike. The following year in New York, cloak and shirt makers, men and women (holding separate meetings but acting together), went on strike. The New York World called it ""a revolt for bread and butter."" They won higher wages and shorter hours.
That winter in Yonkers, a few women carpet weavers were fired for joining the Knights, and in the cold of February, 2,500 women walked out and picketed the mill. Only seven hundred of them were members of the Knights, but all the strikers soon joined. The police attacked the picket line and arrested them, but a jury found them not guilty. A great dinner was held by working people in New York to honor them, with two thousand delegates from unions all over the city. The strike lasted six months, and the women won some of their demands, getting back their jobs, but without recognition of their union.
What was astonishing in so many of these struggles was not that the strikers did not win all that they wanted, but that, against such great odds, they dared to resist, and were not destroyed.
Perhaps it was the recognition that day-to-day combat was not enough, that fundamental change was needed, which stimulated the growth of revolutionary movements at this time. The Socialist Labor party, formed in 1877, was tiny, and torn by internal arguments, but it had some influence in organizing unions among foreign workers. In New York, Jewish socialists organized and put out a newspaper. In Chicago, German revolutionaries, along with native-born radicals like Albert Parsons, formed Social Revolutionary clubs. In 1883, an anarchist congress took place in Pittsburgh. It drew up a manifesto:
... All laws are directed against the working people. . .. Even the school serves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring of the wealthy with those qualities necessary to uphold their class domination. The children of the poor get scarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, is mainly directed to such branches as tend to producing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, want of sense. The Church finally seeks to make complete idiots out of the mass and to make them forego the paradise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. The capitalist press, on the other hand, takes care of the confusion of spirits in public life. . .. The workers can therefore expect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggle against the existing system. They must achieve their liberation by their own efforts. As in former times, a privileged class never surrenders its tyranny, neither can it be expected that the capitalists of this age will give up their rulership without being forced to do it. ...
The manifesto asked ""equal rights for all without distinction to sex or race."" It quoted the Communist Manifesto: ""Workmen of all lands, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a world to win!""
In Chicago, the new International Working People's Association had five thousand members, published newspapers in five languages, organized mass demonstrations and parades, and through its leadership in strikes was a powerful influence in the twenty-two unions that made up the Central Labor Union of Chicago. There were differences in theory among all these revolutionary groups, but the theorists were often brought together by the practical needs of labor struggles, and there were many in the mid-1880s.
In early 1886, the Texas & Pacific Railroad fired a leader of the district assembly of the Knights of Labor, and this led to a strike which spread throughout the Southwest, tying up traffic as far as St. Louis and Kansas City. Nine young men recruited in New Orleans as marshals, brought to Texas to protect company property, learned about the strike and quit their jobs, saying, ""as man to man we could not justifiably go to work and take the bread out of our fellow-workmen's mouths, no matter how much we needed it ourselves."" They were then arrested for defrauding the company by refusing to work, and sentenced to three months in the Galveston county jail.
The strikers engaged in sabotage. A news dispatch from Atchison, Kansas:
At 12:45 this morning the men on guard at the Missouri Pacific roundhouse were surprised by the appearance of 35 or 40 masked men. The guards were corralled in the oil room by a detachment of the visitors who stood guard with pistols .. . while the rest of them thoroughly disabled 12 locomotives which stood in the stalls.
In April, in East St. Louis, there was a battle between strikers and police. Seven workingmen were killed, whereupon workers burned the freight depot of the Louisville & Nashville. The governor declared martial law and sent in seven hundred National Guardsmen. With mass arrests, violent attacks by sheriffs and deputies, no support from the skilled, paid-paid workers of the Railway Brotherhoods, the strikers could not hold out. After several months they surrendered, and many of them were blacklisted.
By the spring of 1886, the movement for an eight-hour day had grown. On May 1, the American Federation of Labor, now five years old, called for nationwide strikes wherever the eight-hour day was refused. Terence Powderly, head of the Knights of Labor, opposed the strike, saying that employers and employees must first be educated on the eight-hour day, but assemblies of the Knights made plans to strike. The grand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers opposed the eight-hour day, saying ""two hours less work means two hours more loafing about the corners and two hours more for drink,"" but railroad workers did not agree and supported the eight- hour movement.
So, 350,000 workers in 11,562 establishments all over the country went out on strike. In Detroit, 11,000 workers marched in an eight-hour parade. In New York, 25,000 formed a torchlight procession along Broadway, headed by 3,400 members of the Bakers' Union. In Chicago, 40,000 struck, and 45,000 were granted a shorter working day to prevent them from striking. Every railroad in Chicago stopped running, and most of the industries in Chicago were paralyzed. The stockyards were closed down.
A ""Citizens' Committee"" of businessmen met daily to map strategy in Chicago. The state militia had been called out, the police were ready, and the Chicago Mail on May 1 asked that Albert Parsons and August Spies, the anarchist leaders of the International Working People's Association, be watched. ""Keep them in view. Hold them personally responsible for any trouble that occurs. Make an example of them if trouble occurs.""
Under the leadership of Parsons and Spies, the Central Labor Union, with twenty-two unions, had adopted a fiery resolution in the fall of 1885:
Be it Resolved, That we urgently call upon the wage-earning class to arm itself in order to be able to put forth against their exploiters such an argument which alone can be effective: Violence, and further be it Resolved, that notwithstanding that we expect very little from the introduction of the eight-hour day, we firmly promise to assist our more backward brethren in this class struggle with all means and power at our disposal, so long as they will continue to show an open and resolute front to our common oppressors, the aristocratic vagabonds and exploiters. Our war-cry is ""Death to the foes of the human race.""
On May 3, a series of events took place which were to put Parsons and Spies in exactly the position that the Chicago Mail had suggested (""Make an example of them if trouble occurs""). That day, in front of the McCormick Harvester Works, where strikers and sympathizers fought scabs, the police fired into a crowd of strikers running from the scene, wounded many of them, and killed four. Spies, enraged, went to the printing shop of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and printed a circular in both English and German:
Revenge!
Workingmen, to Arms!!!
. . . You have for years endured the most abject humiliations; . . . you have worked yourself to death... your Children you have sacrificed to the factory lord-in short: you have been miserable and obedient slaves all these years: Why? To satisfy the insatiable greed, to fill the coffers of your thieving master? When you ask them now to lessen your burdens, he sends his bloodhounds out to shoot you, kill you!
... To arms we call you, to arms!
A meeting was called for Haymarket Square on the evening of May 4, and about three thousand persons assembled. It was a quiet meeting, and as storm clouds gathered and the hour grew late, the crowd dwindled to a few hundred. A detachment of 180 policemen showed up, advanced on the speakers' platform, ordered the crowd to disperse. The speaker said the meeting was almost over. A bomb then exploded in the midst of the police, wounding sixty-six policemen, of whom seven later died. The police fired into the crowd, killing several people, wounding two hundred.
With no evidence on who threw the bomb, the police arrested eight anarchist leaders in Chicago. The Chicago Journal said: ""Justice should be prompt in dealing with the arrested anarchists. The law regarding accessories to crime in this State is so plain that their trials will be short."" Illinois law said that anyone inciting a murder was guilty of that murder. The evidence against the eight anarchists was their ideas, their literature; none had been at Haymarket that day except Fielden, who was speaking when the bomb exploded. A jury found them guilty, and they were sentenced to death. Their appeals were denied; the Supreme Court said it had no jurisdiction.
The event aroused international excitement. Meetings took place in France, Holland, Russia, Italy, Spain. In London a meeting of protest was sponsored by George Bernard Shaw, William Morris, and Peter Kropotkin, among others. Shaw had responded in his characteristic way to the turning down of an appeal by the eight members of the Illinois Supreme Court: ""If the world must lose eight of its people, it can better afford to lose the eight members of the Illinois Supreme Court.""
A year after the trial, four of the convicted anarchists-Albert Parsons, a printer, August Spies, an upholsterer, Adolph Eischer, and George Engel-were hanged. Louis Lingg, a twenty-one-year-old carpenter, blew himself up in his cell by exploding a dynamite tube in his mouth. Three remained in prison.
The executions aroused people all over the country. There was a funeral march of 25,000 in Chicago. Some evidence came out that a man named Rudolph Schnaubelt, supposedly an anarchist, was actually an agent of the police, an agent provocateur, hired to throw the bomb and thus enable the arrest of hundreds, the destruction of the revolutionary leadership in Chicago. But to this day it has not been discovered who threw the bomb.
While the immediate result was a suppression of the radical movement, the long-term effect was to keep alive the class anger of many, to inspire others-especially young people of that generation-to action in revolutionary causes. Sixty thousand signed petitions to the new governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld, who investigated the facts, denounced what had happened, and pardoned the three remaining prisoners. Year after year, all over the country, memorial meetings for the Haymarket martyrs were held; it is impossible to know the number of individuals whose political awakening-as with Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, long-time revolutionary stalwarts of the next generation-came from the Haymarket Affair.
(As late as 1968, the Haymarket events were alive; in that year a group of young radicals in Chicago blew up the monument that had been erected to the memory of the police who died in the explosion. And the trial of eight leaders of the antiwar movement in Chicago around that time evoked, in the press, in meetings, and in literature, the memory of the first ""Chicago Eight,"" on trial for their ideas.)
After Haymarket, class conflict and violence continued, with strikes, lockouts, blacklisting, the use of Pinkerton detectives and police to break strikes with force, and courts to break them by law. During a strike of streetcar conductors on the Third Avenue Line in New York a month after the Haymarket Affair, police charged a crowd of thousands, using their clubs indiscriminately: ""The New York Sun reported: ""Men with broken scalps were crawling off in all directions....""
Some of the energy of resentment in late 1886 was poured into the electoral campaign for mayor of New York that fall. Trade unions formed an Independent Labor party and nominated for mayor Henry George, the radical economist, whose Progress and Poverty had been read by tens of thousands of workers. George's platform tells something about the conditions of life for workers in New York in the 1880s. It demanded:
That property qualifications be abolished for members of juries.
That Grand Jurors be chosen from the lower-class as well as from the upperclass, which dominated Grand Juries.
That the police not interfere with peaceful meetings.
That the sanitary inspection of buildings be enforced.
That contract labor be abolished in public works.
That there be equal pay for equal work for women.
That the streetcars be owned by the municipal government.
The Democrats nominated an iron manufacturer, Abram Hewitt, and the Republicans nominated Theodore Roosevelt, at a convention presided over by Elihu Root, a corporation lawyer, with the nominating speech given by Chauncey Depew, a railroad director. In a campaign of coercion and bribery, Hewitt was elected with 41 percent of the vote, George came second with 31 percent of the vote, and Roosevelt third with 2 7 percent of the vote. The New York World saw this as a signal:
The deep-voiced protest conveyed in the 67,000 votes for Henry George against the combined power of both political parties, of Wall Street and the business interests, and of the public press should be a warning to the community to heed the demands of Labor so far as they are just and reasonable. . ..
In other cities in the country too, labor candidates ran, polling 25,000 out of 92,000 votes in Chicago, electing a mayor in Milwaukee, and various local officials in Fort Worth, Texas, Eaton, Ohio, and Leadville, Colorado.
It seemed that the weight of Haymarket had not crushed the labor movement. The year 1886 became known to contemporaries as ""the year of the great uprising of labor."" From 1881 to 1885, strikes had averaged about 500 each year, involving perhaps 150,000 workers each year. In 1886 there were over 1,400 strikes, involving 500,000 workers. John Commons, in his History of the Labor Movement in the United States, saw in that:
... the signs of a great movement by the class of the unskilled, which had finally risen in rebellion.. . . The movement bore in every way the aspect of a social war. A frenzied hatred of labour for capital was shown in every important strike.. .. Extreme bitterness toward capital manifested itself in all the actions of the Knights of Labor, and wherever the leaders undertook to hold it within bounds, they were generally discarded by their followers. . ..
Even among southern blacks, where all the military, political, and economic force of the southern states, with the acquiescence of the national government, was concentrated on keeping them docile and working, there were sporadic rebellions. In the cotton fields, blacks were dispersed in their work, but in the sugar fields, work was done in gangs, so there was opportunity for organized action. In 1880, they had struck to get a dollar a day instead of 75 cents, threatening to leave the state. Strikers were arrested and jailed, but they walked the roads along the sugar fields, carrying banners: ""A DOLLAR A DAY OR KANSAS."" They were arrested again and again for trespassing, and the strike was broken.
By 1886, however, the Knights of Labor was organizing in the sugar fields, in the peak year of the Knights' influence. The black workers, unable to feed and clothe their families on their wages, often paid in store scrip, asked a dollar a day once more. The following year, in the fall, close to ten thousand sugar laborers went on strike, 90 percent of them Negroes and members of the Knights. The militia arrived and gun battles began.
Violence erupted in the town of Thibodaux, which had become a kind of refugee village where hundreds of strikers, evicted from their plantation shacks, gathered, penniless and ragged, carrying their bed clothing and babies. Their refusal to work threatened the entire sugar crop, and martial law was declared in Thibodaux. Henry and George Cox, two Negro brothers, leaders in the Knights of Labor, were arrested, locked up, then taken from their cells, and never heard from again. On the night of November 22, shooting broke out, each side claiming the other was at fault; by noon the next day, thirty Negroes were dead or dying, and hundreds wounded. Two whites were wounded. A Negro newspaper in New Orleans wrote:
. . . Lame men and blind women shot; children and hoary-headed grandsires ruthlessly swept down! The Negroes offered no resistance; they could not, as the killing was unexpected. Those of them not killed took to the woods, a majority of them finding refuge in this city.. . .
Citizens of the United States killed by a mob directed by a State judge. .. . Laboring men seeking an advance in wages, treated as if they were dogs! . ..
At such times and upon such occasions, words of condemnation fall like snow-flakes upon molten lead. The blacks should defend their lives, and if needs must die, die with their faces toward their persecutors fighting for their homes, their children and their lawful rights.
Native-born poor whites were not doing well either. In the South, they were tenant farmers rather than landowners. In the southern cities, they were tenants, not homeowners. C. Vann Woodward notes (Origins of the New South) that the city with the highest rate of tenancy in the United States was Birmingham, with 90 percent. And the slums of the southern cities were among the worst, poor whites living like the blacks, on unpaved dirt streets ""choked up with garbage, filth and mud,"" according to a report of one state board of health.
There were eruptions against the convict labor system in the South, in which prisoners were leased in slave labor to corporations, used thus to depress the general level of wages and also to break strikes. In the year 1891, miners of the Tennessee Coal Mine Company were asked to sign an ""iron- clad contract"": pledging no strikes, agreeing to get paid in scrip, and giving up the right to check the weight of the coal they mined (they were paid by the weight). They refused to sign and were evicted from their houses. Convicts were brought in to replace them.
On the night of October 31, 1891, a thousand armed miners took control of the mine area, set five hundred convicts free, and burned down the stockades in which the convicts were kept. The companies surrendered, agreeing not to use convicts, not to require the ""ironclad contract/' and to let the miners check on the weight of the coal they mined.
The following year, there were more such incidents in Tennessee. C. Vann Woodward calls them ""insurrections."" Miners overpowered guards of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company, burned the stockades, shipped the convicts to Nashville. Other unions in Tennessee came to their aid. An observer reported back to the Chattanooga Federation of Trades:
I should like to impress upon people the extent of this movement. I have seen the written assurance of reinforcements to the miners of fully 7500 men, who will be on the field in ten hours after the first shot is fired. . .. The entire district is as one over the main proposition, ""the convicts must go"". I counted 840 rifles on Monday as the miners passed, while the vast multitude following them carried revolvers. The captains of the different companies are all Grand Army men. Whites and Negroes are standing shoulder to shoulder.
That same year, in New Orleans, forty-two union locals, with over twenty thousand members, mostly white but including some blacks (there was one black on the strike committee), called a general strike, involving half the population of the city. Work in New Orleans came to a stop. After three days-with strikebreakers brought in, martial law, and the threat of militia-the strike ended with a compromise, gaining hours and wages but without recognition of the unions as bargaining agents.
The year 1892 saw strike struggles all over the country: besides the general strike in New Orleans and the coal miners' strike in Tennessee, there was a railroad switchmen's strike in Buffalo, New York, and a copper miners' strike in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The Coeur d'Alene strike was marked by gun battles between strikers and strikebreakers, and many deaths. A newspaper account of July 11, 1892, reported:
... The long-dreaded conflict between the forces of the strikers and the nonunion men who have taken their places has come at last. As a result five men are known to be dead and 16 are already in the hospital; the Frisco mill on Canyon Creek is in ruins; the Gem mine has surrendered to the strikers, the arms of its employees have been captured, and the employees themselves have been ordered out of the country. Flushed with the success of these victories the turbulent element among the strikers are preparing to move upon other strongholds of the non-union men... .
The National Guard, brought in by the governor, was reinforced by federal troops: six hundred miners were rounded up and imprisoned in bullpens, scabs brought back, union leaders fired, the strike broken.
In early 1892, the Carnegie Steel plant at Homestead, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh, was being managed by Henry Clay Frick while Carnegie was in Europe. Frick decided to reduce the workers' wages and break their union. He built a fence 3 miles long and 12 feet high around the steelworks and topped it with barbed wire, adding peepholes for rifles. When the workers did not accept the pay cut, Frick laid off the entire work force. The Pinkerton detective agency was hired to protect strikebreakers.
Although only 750 of the 3,800 workers at Homestead belonged to the union, three thousand workers met in the Opera House and voted overwhelmingly to strike. The plant was on the Monongahela River, and a thousand pickets began patrolling a 10-mile stretch of the river. A committee of strikers took over the town, and the sheriff was unable to raise a posse among local people against them.
On the night of July 5, 1892, hundreds of Pinkerton guards boarded barges 5 miles down the river from Homestead and moved toward the plant, where ten thousand strikers and sympathizers waited. The crowd warned the Pinkertons not to step off the barge. A striker lay down on the gangplank, and when a Pinkerton man tried to shove him aside, he fired, wounding the detective in the thigh. In the gunfire that followed on both sides, seven workers were killed.
The Pinkertons had to retreat onto the barges. They were attacked from all sides, voted to surrender, and then were beaten by the enraged crowd. There were dead on both sides. For the next several days the strikers were in command of the area. Now the state went into action: the governor brought in the militia, armed with the latest rifles and Gatling guns, to protect the import of strikebreakers.
Strike leaders were charged with murder; 160 other strikers were tried for other crimes. All were acquitted by friendly juries. The entire Strike Committee was then arrested for treason against the state, but no jury would convict them. The strike held for four months, but the plant was producing steel with strikebreakers who were brought in, often in locked trains, not knowing their destination, not knowing a strike was on. The strikers, with no resources left, agreed to return to work, their leaders blacklisted.
One reason for the defeat was that the strike was confined to Homestead, and other plants of Carnegie kept working. Some blast furnace workers did strike, but they were quickly defeated, and the pig iron from those furnaces was then used at Homestead. The defeat kept unionization from the Carnegie plants well into the twentieth century, and the workers took wage cuts and increases in hours without organized resistance.
In the midst of the Homestead strike, a young anarchist from New York named Alexander Berkman, in a plan prepared by anarchist friends in New York, including his lover Emma Goldman, came to Pittsburgh and entered the office of Henry Clay Frick, determined to kill him. Berkman's aim was poor; he wounded Frick and was overwhelmed, then was tried and found guilty of attempted murder. He served fourteen years in the state penitentiary. His Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist gave a graphic description of the assassination attempt and of his years in prison, when he changed his mind about the usefulness of assassinations but remained a dedicated revolutionary. Emma Goldman's autobiography, Living My Life, conveys the anger, the sense of injustice, the desire for a new kind of life, that grew among the young radicals of that day.
The year 1893 saw the biggest economic crisis in the country's history. After several decades of wild industrial growth, financial manipulation, uncontrolled speculation and profiteering, it all collapsed: 642 banks failed and 16,000 businesses closed down. Out of the labor force of 15 million, 3 million were unemployed. No state government voted relief, but mass demonstrations all over the country forced city governments to set up soup kitchens and give people work on streets or parks.
In New York City, in Union Square, Emma Goldman addressed a huge meeting of the unemployed and urged those whose children needed food to go into the stores and take it. She was arrested for ""inciting to riot"" and sentenced to two years in prison. In Chicago, it was estimated that 200,000 people were without work, the floors and stairways of City Hall and the police stations packed every night with homeless men trying to sleep.
The Depression lasted for years and brought a wave of strikes throughout the country. The largest of these was the nationwide strike of railroad workers in 1894 that began at the Pullman Company in Illinois, just outside of Chicago.
Annual wages of railroad workers, according to the report of the commissioner of labor in 1890, were $957 for engineers, the aristocrats of the railroad-but $575 for conductors, $212 for brakemen, and $124 for laborers. Railroad work was one of the most dangerous jobs in America; over two thousand railroad workers were being killed each year, and thirty thousand injured. The railroad companies called these ""acts of God"" or the result of ""carelessness"" on the part of the workers, but the Locomotive Firemen's Magazine said: ""It comes to this: while railroad managers reduce their force and require men to do double duty, involving loss of rest and sleep . . . the accidents are chargeable to the greed of the corporation.""
It was the Depression of 1893 that propelled Eugene Debs into a lifetime of action for unionism and socialism. Debs was from Terre Haute, Indiana, where his father and mother ran a store. He had worked on the railroads for four years until he was nineteen, but left when a friend was killed after falling under a locomotive. He came back to join a Railroad Brotherhood as a billing clerk. At the time of the great strikes of 1877, Debs opposed them and argued there was no ""necessary conflict between capital and labor."" But when he read Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, it deeply affected him. He followed the events at Homestead, Coeur d'Alene, the Buffalo switchmen's strike, and wrote:
If the year 1892 taught the world any lesson worthy of heed, it was that the capitalist class, like a devilfish, had grasped them with its tentacles and was dragging them down to fathomless depths of degradation. To escape the prehensile clutch of these monsters, constitutes a standing challenge to organized labor for 1893.
In the midst of the economic crisis of 1893, a small group of railroad workers, including Debs, formed the American Railway Union, to unite all railway workers. Debs said:
A life purpose of mine has been the federation of railroad employees. To unify them into one great body is my object. . . . Class enrollment fosters class prejudices and class selfishness. ... It has been my life's desire to unify railroad employees and to eliminate the aristocracy of labor ... and organize them so all will be on an equality. ...
Knights of Labor people came in, virtually merging the old Knights with the American Railway Union, according to labor historian David Montgomery.
Debs wanted to include everyone, but blacks were kept out: at a convention in 1894, the provision in the constitution barring blacks was affirmed by a vote of 112 to 100. Later, Debs thought this might have had a crucial effect on the outcome of the Pullman strike, for black workers were in no mood to cooperate with the strikers.
In June 1894, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike. One can get an idea of the kind of support they got, mostly from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, in the first months of the strike, from a list of contributions put together by the Reverend William H. Carwardine, a Methodist pastor in the company town of Pullman for three years (he was sent away after he supported the strikers):
Typographical Union #16
Painters and Decorators Union #147
Carpenters' Union No. 23
Thirty- fourth Ward Republican Club
Grand Crossing Police
Hyde Park Water Department
Picnic at Gardener's Park
Milk Dealer's Union
Hyde Park Liquor Dealers
Fourteenth Precinct Police Station
Swedish Concert
Chicago Fire Department
German Singing Society
Cheque from Anaconda, Montana
The Pullman strikers appealed to a convention of the American Railway Union for support:
Mr. President and Brothers of the American Railway Union. We struck at Pullman because we were without hope. We joined the American Railway Union because it gave us a glimmer of hope. Twenty thousand souls, men, women and little ones, have their eyes turned toward this convention today, straining eagerly through dark despondency for a glimmer of the heavensent message you alone can give us on this earth... .
You all must know that the proximate cause of our strike was the discharge of two members of our grievance committee.... Five reductions in wages.. .. The last was the most severe, amounting to nearly thirty per cent, and rents had not fallen. .. .
Water which Pullman buys from the city at 8 cents a thousand gallons he retails lo us at 500 percent advance. .. . Gas which sells at 75 cents per thousand feet in Hyde Park, just north of us, he sells for $2.25. When we went to tell him our grievances he said we were all his ""children."".. .
Pullman, both the man and the town, is an ulcer on the body politic. He owns the houses, the schoolhouses, and churches of God in the town he gave his once humble name....
And thus the merry war-the dance of skeletons bathed in human tears-goes on, and it will go on, brothers, forever, unless you, the American Railway Union, stop it; end it; crush it out.
The American Railway Union responded. It asked its members all over the country not to handle Pullman cars. Since virtually all passenger trains had Pullman cars, this amounted to a boycott of all trains-a nationwide strike. Soon all traffic on the twenty-four railroad lines leading out of Chicago had come to a halt. Workers derailed freight cars, blocked tracks, pulled engineers off trains if they refused to cooperate.
The General Managers Association, representing the railroad owners, agreed to pay two thousand deputies, sent in to break the strike. But the strike went on. The Attorney General of the United States, Richard Olney, a former railroad lawyer, now got a court injunction against blocking trains, on the legal ground that the federal mails were being interfered with. When the strikers ignored the injunction, President Cleveland ordered federal troops to Chicago. On July 6, hundreds of cars were burned by strikers.
The following day, the state militia moved in, and the Chicago Times reported on what followed:
Company C. Second Regiment . . . disciplined a mob of rioters yesterday afternoon at Forty-ninth and Loomis Streets. The police assisted and . . . finished the job. There is no means of knowing how many rioters were killed or wounded. The mob carried off many of its dying and injured.
A crowd of five thousand gathered. Rocks were thrown at the militia, and the command was given to fire.
... To say that the mob went wild is but a weak expression.. . . The command to charge was given. . .. From that moment only bayonets were used. ... A dozen men in the front line of rioters received bayonet wounds. . ..
Tearing up cobble stones, the mob made a determined charge.... the word was passed along the line for each officer to take care of himself. One by one, as occasion demanded, they fired point blank into the crowd.. .. The police followed with their clubs. A wire fence enclosed the track. The rioters had forgotten it; when they turned to fly they were caught in a trap.
The police were not inclined to be merciful, and driving the mob against the barbed wires clubbed it unmercifully. .. . The crowd outside the fence rallied to the assistance of the rioters.... The shower of stones was incessant. . ..
The ground over which the fight had occurred was like a battlefield. The men shot by the troops and police lay about like logs.. ..
In Chicago that day, thirteen people were killed, fifty-three seriously wounded, seven hundred arrested. Before the strike was over, perhaps thirty-four were dead. With fourteen thousand police, militia, troops in Chicago, the strike was crushed. Debs was arrested for contempt of court, for violating the injunction that said he could not do or say anything to carry on the strike. He told the court: ""It seems to me that if it were not for resistance to degrading conditions, the tendency of our whole civilization would be downward; after a while we would reach the point where there would be no resistance, and slavery would come.""
Debs, in court, denied he was a socialist. But during his six months in prison, he studied socialism and talked to fellow prisoners who were socialists. Later he wrote: ""I was to be baptized in Socialism in the roar of conflict... in the gleam of every bayonet and the flash of every rifle the class struggle was revealed. ... This was my first practical struggle in Socialism.""
Two years after he came out of prison, Debs wrote in the Railway Times:
The issue is Socialism versus Capitalism. I am for Socialism because I am for humanity. We have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough. Money constitutes no proper basis of civilization. The time has come to regenerate society-we are on the eve of a universal change.
Thus, the eighties and nineties saw bursts of labor insurrection, more organized than the spontaneous strikes of 1877. There were now revolutionary movements influencing labor struggles, the ideas of socialism affecting labor leaders. Radical literature was appearing, speaking of fundamental changes, of new possibilities for living.
In this same period, those who worked on the land-farmers, North and South, black and white-were going far beyond the scattered tenant protests of the pre-Civil War years and creating the greatest movement of agrarian rebellion the country had ever seen.
When the Homestead Act was being discussed in Congress in 1860, a Senator from Wisconsin said he supported it:
.. . because its benign operation will postpone for centuries, if it will not forever, all serious conflict between capital and labor in the older free States, withdrawing their surplus population to create in greater abundance the means of subsistence.
The Homestead Act did not have that effect. It did not bring tranquility to the East by moving Americans to the West. It was not a safety valve for discontent, which was too great to be contained that way. As Henry Nash Smith says (Virgin Land), and as we have seen: ""On the contrary, the three decades following its passage were marked by the most bitter and widespread labor trouble that had yet been seen in the United States.""
It also failed to bring peace to the farm country of the West. Hamlin Garland, who made so many Americans aware of the life of the farmer, wrote in the preface to his novel Jason Edwards: 'Tree land is gone. The last acre of available farmland has now passed into private or corporate hands."" In Jason Edwards a Boston mechanic takes his family West, drawn by advertising circulars. But he finds that all land within 30 miles of a railroad has been taken up by speculators. He struggles for five years to pay off a loan and get title to his farm, and then a storm destroys his wheat just before harvest.
Behind the despair so often registered in the farm country literature of that day, there must have been visions, from time to time, of a different way to live. In another Garland novel, A Spoil of Office, the heroine speaks at a farmers' picnic:
I see a time when the farmer will not need to live in a cabin on a lonely farm. I see the farmers coming together in groups. I see them with time to read, and time to visit with their fellows. I see them enjoying lectures in beautiful halls, erected in every village. I see them gather like the Saxons of old upon the green at evening to sing and dance. I see cities rising near them with schools, and churches, and concert halls and theaters. I see a day when the farmer will no longer be a drudge and his wife a bond slave, but happy men and women who will go singing to their pleasant tasks upon their fruitful farms. When the boys and girls will not go west nor to the city; when life will be worth living. In that day the moon will be brighter and the stars more glad, and pleasure and poetry and love of life come back to the man who tills the soil.
Hamlin Garland dedicated Jason Edwards, written in 1891, to the Farmers Alliance. It was the Farmers Alliance that was the core of the great movement of the 1880s and 1890s later known as the Populist Movement.
Between 1860 and 1910, the U.S. army, wiping out the Indian villages on the Great Plains, paved the way for the railroads to move in and take the best land. Then the farmers came for what was left. From 1860 to 1900 the population of the United States grew from 31 million to 75 million; now 20 million people lived west of the Mississippi, and the number of farms grew from 2 million to 6 million. With the crowded cities of the East needing food, the internal market for food was more than doubled; 82 percent of the farm produce was sold inside the United States.
Farming became mechanized-steel plows, mowing machines, reapers, harvesters, improved cotton gins for pulling the fibers away from the seed, and, by the turn of the century, giant combines that cut the grain, threshed it, and put it in bags. In 1830 a bushel of wheat had taken three hours to produce. By 1900, it took ten minutes. Specialization developed by region: cotton and tobacco in the South, wheat and corn in the Midwest.
Land cost money, and machines cost money-so farmers had to borrow, hoping that the prices of their harvests would stay high, so they could pay the bank for the loan, the railroad for transportation, the grain merchant for handling their grain, the storage elevator for storing it. But they found the prices for their produce going down, and the prices of transportation and loans going up, because the individual farmer could not control the price of his grain, while the monopolist railroad and the monopolist banker could charge what they liked.
William Faulkner, in his novel The Hamlet, described the man on whom southern farmers depended:
He was the largest landholder ... in one county, and Justice of the Peace in the next, and election commissioner in both.... He was a farmer, a usurer, a veterinarian.... He owned most of the good land in the county and held mortgages on most of the rest. He owned the store and the cotton gin and the combined grist mill and blacksmith shop.. ..
The farmers who could not pay saw their homes and land taken away. They became tenants. By 1880, 25 percent of all farms were rented by tenants, and the number kept rising. Many did not even have money to rent and became farm laborers; by 1900 there were 4 1/2 million farm laborers in the country. It was the fate that awaited every farmer who couldn't pay his debts.
Could the squeezed and desperate farmer turn to the government for help? Lawrence Goodwyn, in his study of the Populist movement (The Democratic Promise), says that after the Civil War both parties now were controlled by capitalists. They were divided along North-South lines, still hung over with the animosities of the Civil War. This made it very hard to create a party of reform cutting across both parties to unite working people South and North-to say nothing of black and white, foreign-born and native-born.
The government played its part in helping the bankers and hurting the farmers; it kept the amount of money-based on the gold supply- steady, while the population rose, so there was less and less money in circulation. The farmer had to pay off his debts in dollars that were harder to get. The bankers, getting the loans back, were getting dollars worth more than when they loaned them out-a kind of interest on top of interest. That is why so much of the talk of farmers' movements in those days had to do with putting more money in circulation-by printing greenbacks (paper money for which there was no gold in the treasury) or by making silver a basis for issuing money.
It was in Texas that the Farmers Alliance movement began. It was in the South that the crop-lien system was most brutal. By this system the farmer would get the things he needed from the merchant: the use of the cotton gin at harvest time, whatever supplies were necessary. He didn't have money to pay, so the merchant would get a lien-a mortgage on his crop-on which the farmer might pay 25 percent interest. Goodwyn says ""the crop lien system became for millions of Southerners, white and black, little more than a modified form of slavery."" The man with the ledger became to the farmer ""the furnishing man,"" to black farmers simply ""the Man."" The farmer would owe more money every year until finally his farm was taken away and he became a tenant.
Goodwyn gives two personal histories to illustrate this. A white farmer in South Carolina, between 1887 and 1895, bought goods and services from the furnishing merchant for $2,681.02 but was able to pay only $687.31, and finally he had to give his land to the merchant. A black farmer named Matt Brown, in Black Hawk, Mississippi, between 1884 and 1901, bought his supplies from the Jones store, kept falling further and further behind, and in 1905 the last entry in the merchant's ledger is for a coffin and burial supplies.
How many rebellions took place against this system we don't know. In Delhi, Louisiana, in 1889, a gathering of small farmers rode into town and demolished the stores of merchants ""to cancel their indebtedness,"" they said.
In the height of the 1877 Depression, a group of white farmers gathered together on a farm in Texas and formed the first ""Farmers Alliance."" In a few years, it was across the state. By 1882, there were 120 suballiances in twelve counties. By 1886, 100,000 farmers had joined in two thousand suballiances. They began to offer alternatives to the old system: join the Alliance and form cooperatives; buy things together and get lower prices. They began putting their cotton together and selling it cooperatively-they called it ""bulking.""
In some states a Grange movement developed; it managed to get laws passed to help farmers. But the Grange, as one of its newspapers put it, ""is essentially conservative and furnishes a stable, well- organized, rational and orderly opposition to encroachments upon the liberties of the people, in contrast to the lawless, desperate attempts of communism."" It was a time of crisis, and the Grange was doing too little. It lost members, while the Farmers Alliance kept growing.
From the beginning, the Farmers Alliance showed sympathy with the growing labor movement. When Knights of Labor men went on strike against a steamship line in Galveston, Texas, one of the radical leaders of the Texas Alliance, William Lamb, spoke for many (but not all) Alliance members when he said in an open letter to Alliance people: ""Knowing that the day is not far distant when the Farmers Alliance will have to use Boycott on manufacturers in order to get goods direct, we think it is a good time to help the Knights of Labor. . .."" Goodwyn says: ""Alliance radicalism- Populism-began with this letter.""
The Texas Alliance president opposed joining the boycott, but a group of Alliance people in Texas passed a resolution:
Whereas we see the unjust encroachments that the capitalists are making upon all the different departments of labor ... we extend to the Knights of Labor our hearty sympathy in their manly struggle against monopolistic oppression and ... we propose to stand by the Knights.
In the summer of 1886, in the town of Cleburne, near Dallas, the Alliance gathered and drew up what came to be known as the ""Cleburne Demands""-the first document of the Populist movement, asking ""such legislation as shall secure to our people freedom from the onerous and shameful abuses that the industrial classes are now suffering at the hands of arrogant capitalists and powerful corporations."" They called for a national conference of all labor organizations ""to discuss such measures as may be of interest to the laboring classes,"" and proposed regulation of railroad rates, heavy taxation of land held only for speculative purposes, and an increase in the money supply.
The Alliance kept growing. By early 1887, it had 200,000 members in three thousand suballiances. By 1892 farmer lecturers had gone into forty-three states and reached 2 million farm families in what Goodwyn calls ""the most massive organizing drive by any citizen institution of nineteenth century America,"" It was a drive based on the idea of cooperation, of farmers creating their own culture, their own political parties, gaining a respect not given them by the nation's powerful industrial and political leaders.
Organizers from Texas came to Georgia to form alliances, and in three years Georgia had 100,000 members in 134 of the 137 counties. In Tennessee, there were soon 125,000 members and 3,600 suballiances in ninety-two of the state's ninety-six counties. The Alliance moved into Mississippi ""like a cyclone,"" someone said, and into Louisiana and North Carolina. Then northward into Kansas and the Dakotas, where thirty-five cooperative warehouses were set up.
One of the leading figures in Kansas was Henry Vincent, who started a journal in 1886 called The American Nonconformist and Kansas Industrial Liberator, saying in the first issue:
This journal will aim to publish such matter as will tend to the education of the laboring classes, the farmers and the producer, and in every struggle it will endeavor to take the side of the oppressed as against the oppressor.. ..
By 1889, the Kansas Alliance had fifty thousand members and was electing local candidates to office.
Now there were 400,000 members in the National Farmers Alliance. And the conditions spurring the Alliance onward got worse. Corn which had brought 45 cents a bushel in 1870 brought 10 cents a bushel in 1889. Harvesting wheat required a machine to bind the wheat before it became too dry, and this cost several hundred dollars, which the farmer had to buy on credit, knowing the $200 would be twice as hard to get in a few years. Then he had pay a bushel of corn in freight costs for every bushel he shipped. He had to pay the high prices demanded by the grain elevators at the terminals. In the South the situation was worse than anywhere-90 percent of the farmers lived on credit.
To meet this situation, the Texas Alliance formed a statewide cooperative, a great Texas Exchange, which handled the selling of the farmers' cotton in one great transaction. But the Exchange itself needed loans to advance credit to its members; the banks refused. A call was issued to farmers to scrape together the needed capital for the Exchange to operate. Thousands came on June 9, 1888, to two hundred Texas courthouses and made their contributions, pledging $200,000. Ultimately, $80,000 was actually collected. It was not enough. The farmers' poverty prevented them from helping themselves. The banks won, and this persuaded the Alliances that monetary reform was crucial.
There was one victory along the way. Farmers were being charged too much for jute bags (to put cotton in), which were controlled by a trust. The Alliance farmers organized a boycott of jute, made their own bags out of cotton, and forced the jute manufacturers to start selling their bags at 5 cents a yard instead of 14 cents.
The complexity of Populist belief was shown in one of its important leaders in Texas, Charles Macune. He was a radical in economics (antitrust, and capitalist), a conservative in politics (against a new party independent of the Democrats), and a racist. Macune came forward with a plan that was to become central to the Populist platform-the sub-Treasury plan. The government would have its own warehouses where farmers would store produce and get certificates from this sub-Treasury. These would be greenbacks, and thus much more currency would be made available, not dependent on gold or silver, but based on the amount of farm produce.
There were more Alliance experiments. In the Dakotas, a great cooperative insurance plan for farmers insured them against loss of their crops. Where the big insurance companies had asked 50 cents an acre, the cooperative asked 25 cents or less. It issued thirty thousand policies, covering 2 million acres.
Macune's sub-Treasury plan depended on the government. And since it would not be taken up by the two major parties, it meant (against Macune's own beliefs) organizing a third party. The Alliances went to work. In 1890 thirty-eight Alliance people were elected to Congress. In the South, the Alliance elected governors in Georgia and Texas. It took over the Democratic party in Georgia and won three-fourths of the seats in the Georgia legislature, six of Georgia's ten congressmen.
This was, however, Goodwyn says, ""an elusive revolution, because the party machinery remained in the hands of the old crowd, and the crucial chairmanships of important committees, in Congress, in the state legislatures, remained in the hands of the conservatives, and corporate power, in the states, in the nation, could use its money to still get what it wanted.""
The Alliances were not getting real power, but they were spreading new ideas and a new spirit. Now, as a political party, they became the People's party (or Populist party), and met in convention in 1890 in Topeka, Kansas. The great Populist orator from that state, Mary Ellen Lease, told an enthusiastic crowd:
Wall Street owns the country. It is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street and for Wall Street.... Our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags. . .. the politicians said we suffered from overproduction. Overproduction, when 10,000 little children . .. starve to death every year in the U.S. and over 100,000 shop girls in New York are forced to sell their virtue for bread. ,..
There are thirty men in the United States whose aggregate wealth is over one and one-half billion dollars. There are half a million looking for work.. .. We want money, land and transportation. We want the abolition of the National Banks, and we want the power to make loans direct from the government. We want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out. . . . We will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary, and we will not pay our debts to the loan-shark companies until the Government pays its debts to us.
The people are at bay, let the bloodhounds of money who have dogged us thus far beware.
At the People's party national convention in 1892 in St. Louis, a platform was drawn up. The preamble was written by, and read to the assemblage by, another of the great orators of the movement, Ignatius Donnelly:
We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot box, the legislatures, the Congress, and touches even the ermine of the bench. These people are demoralized. . .. The newspapers are subsidized or muzzled; public opinion silenced; business prostrate, our homes covered with mortgages, labor impoverished, and the land concentrating in the hands of capitalists.
The urban workmen are denied the right of organization for self-protection; imported pauperized labor beats down their wages; a hireling standing army . .. established to shoot them down... . The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes. . .. From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed two classes-paupers and millionaires... .
A People's party nominating convention in Omaha in July of 1892 nominated James Weaver, an Iowa Populist and former general in the Union army, for President. The Populist movement was now tied to the voting system. Their spokesman Polk had said they could ""link their hands and hearts together and march to the ballot box and take possession of the government, restore it to the principles of our fathers, and run it in the interest of the people."" Weaver got over a million votes, but lost.
A new political party had the job of uniting diverse groups-northern Republicans and southern Democrats, urban workers and country farmers, black and white. A Colored Farmers National Alliance grew in the South and had perhaps a million members, but it was organized and led by whites. There were also black organizers, but it was not easy for them to persuade black farmers that, even if economic reforms were won, blacks would have equal access to them. Blacks had tied themselves to the Republican party, the party of Lincoln and civil rights laws. The Democrats were the party of slavery and segregation. As Goodwyn puts it, ""in an era of transcendent white prejudice, the curbing of 'vicious corporate monopoly' did not carry for black farmers the ring of salvation it had for white agrarians.""
There were whites who saw the need for racial unity. One Alabama newspaper wrote:
The white and colored Alliance are united in their war against trusts, and in the promotion of the doctrine that farmers should establish cooperative stores, and manufactures, and publish their own newspapers, conduct their own schools, and have a hand in everything else that concerns them as citizens or affects them personally or collectively.
The official newspaper of the Alabama Knights of Labor, the Alabama Sentinel, wrote: ""The Bourbon Democracy are trying to down the Alliance with the old cry 'nigger'. It won't work though.""
Some Alliance blacks made similar calls for unity. A leader of the Florida Colored Alliance said: ""We are aware of the fact that the laboring colored man's interests and the laboring white man's interest are one and the same.""
When the Texas People's party was founded in Dallas in the summer of 1891, it was interracial, and radical. There was blunt and vigorous debate among whites and blacks. A black delegate, active in the Knights of Labor, dissatisfied with vague statements about ""equality,"" said:
If we are equal, why does not the sheriff summon Negroes on juries? And why hang up the sign ""Negro"", in passenger cars. I want to tell my people what the People's Party is going to do. I want to tell them if it is going to work a black and white horse in the same field.
A white leader responded by urging there be a black delegate from every district in the state. ""They are in the ditch just like we are."" When someone suggested there be separate white and black Populist clubs which would ""confer together,"" R. M. Humphrey, the white leader of the Colored Alliance, objected: ""This will not do. The colored people are part of the people and they must be recognized as such."" Two blacks were then elected to the state executive committee of the party.
Blacks and whites were in different situations. The blacks were mostly field hands, hired laborers; most white Alliance people were farm owners. When the Colored Alliance declared a strike in the cotton fields in 1891 for a dollar a day wages for cotton pickers, Leonidas Polk, head of the white Alliance, denounced it as hurting the Alliance farmer who would have to pay that wage. In Arkansas, a thirty-year-old black cotton picker named Ben Patterson led the strike, traveling from plantation to plantation to get support, his band growing, engaging in gun battles with a white posse. A plantation manager was killed, a cotton gin burned. Patterson and his band were caught, and fifteen of them were shot to death.
There was some black-white unity at the ballot box in the South- resulting in a few blacks elected in North Carolina local elections. An Alabama white farmer wrote to a newspaper in 1892: ""I wish to God that Uncle Sam could put bayonets around the ballot box in the black belt on the first Monday in August so that the Negro could get a fair vote."" There were black delegates to third- party conventions in Georgia: two in 1892, twenty-four in 1894, The Arkansas People's party platform spoke for the ""downtrodden, regardless of race.""
There were moments of racial unity. Lawrence Goodwyn found in east Texas an unusual coalition of black and white public officials: it had begun during Reconstruction and continued into the Populist period. The state government was in the control of white Democrats, but in Grimes County, blacks won local offices and sent legislators to the state capital. The district clerk was a black man; there were black deputy sheriffs and a black school principal. A night-riding White Man's Union used intimidation and murder to split the coalition, but Goodwyn points to ""the long years of interracial cooperation in Grimes County"" and wonders about missed opportunities.
Racism was strong, and the Democratic party played on this, winning many farmers from the Populist party. When white tenants, failing in the crop-lien system, were evicted from their land and replaced by blacks, race hatred intensified. Southern states were drawing up new constitutions, starting with Mississippi in 1890, to prevent blacks from voting by various devices, and to maintain ironclad segregation in every aspect of life.
The laws that took the vote away from blacks-poll taxes, literacy tests, property qualifications-also often ensured that poor whites would not vote. And the political leaders of the South knew this. At the constitutional convention in Alabama, one of the leaders said he wanted to take away the vote from ""all those who are unfit and unqualified, and if the rule strikes a white man as well as a negro let him go."" In North Carolina, the Charlotte Observer saw disfranchisement as ""the struggle of the white people of North Carolina to rid themselves of the dangers of the rule of negroes and the lower class of whites.""
Tom Watson, the Populist leader of Georgia, pleaded for racial unity:
You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings. You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both.
According to the black scholar Robert Alien, taking a look at Populism (Reluctant Reformers), Watson wanted black support for a white man's party. No doubt, when Watson found this support embarrassing and no longer useful, he became as eloquent in affirming racism as he had been in opposing it.
Still, Watson must have addressed some genuine feelings in poor whites whose class oppression gave them some common interest with blacks. When H. S. Doyle, a young black preacher who supported Watson for Congress, was threatened by a lynch mob, he came to Watson for protection, and two thousand white farmers helped Doyle escape.
It was a time that illustrated the complexities of class and race conflict. Fifteen blacks were lynched during Watson's election campaign. And in Georgia after 1891 the Alliance-controlled legislature, Alien points out, ""passed the largest number of anti-black bills ever enacted in a single year in Georgia history."" And yet, in 1896, the Georgia state platform of the People's party denounced lynch law and terrorism, and asked the abolition of the convict lease system.
C. Vann Woodward points to the unique quality of the Populist experience in the South: ""Never before or since have the two races in the South come so close together as they did during the Populist struggles.""
The Populist movement also made a remarkable attempt to create a new and independent culture for the country's farmers. The Alliance Lecture Bureau reached all over the country; it had 35,000 lecturers. The Populists poured out books and pamphlets from their printing presses. Woodward says:
One gathers from yellowed pamphlets that the agrarian ideologists undertook to re-educate their countrymen from the ground up. Dismissing ""history as taught in our schools"" as ""practically valueless"", they undertook to write it over-formidable columns of it, from the Greek down. With no more compunction they turned all hands to the revision of economics, political theory, law, and government.
The National Economist, a Populist magazine, had 100,000 readers. Goodwyn counts over a thousand Populist journals in the 1890s. There were newspapers like the Comrade, published in the cotton country of Louisiana, and the Toiler's Friend, in rural Georgia. Also, Revolution was published in Georgia. In North Carolina, the Populist printing plant was burned. In Alabama, there was the Living Truth. It was broken into in 1892, its type scattered, and the next year the shop was set afire, but the press survived and the editor never missed an issue.
Hundreds of poems and songs came out of the Populist movement, like ""The Farmer Is the Man"": . . . the farmer is the man
The Farmer is the man
Lives on credit till the fall
With the interest rates so high
It's a wonder he don't die
And the mortgage man's the one
That gets it all.
The farmer is the man
The farmer is the man
Lives on credit till the fall
And his pants are wearing thin
His condition it's a sin
He's forgot that he's the man
That feeds them all.
Books written by Populist leaders, such as Henry Demarest Lloyd's Wealth Against Commonwealth, and William Harvey Coin's Financial School, were widely read. An Alabama historian of that time, William Garrott Brown, said about the Populist movement that ""no other political movement-not that of 1776, nor that of 1860-1861-ever altered Southern life so profoundly.""
According to Lawrence Goodwyn, if the labor movement had been able to do in the cities what the Populists did in the rural areas, ""to create among urban workers a culture of cooperation, self- respect, and economic analysis,"" there might have been a great movement for change in the United States. There were only fitful, occasional connections between the farmer and labor movements. Neither spoke eloquently enough to the other's needs. And yet, there were signs of a common consciousness that might, under different circumstances, lead to a unified, ongoing movement.
Norman Pollack says, on the basis of a close study of midwestern Populist newspapers, that ""Populism regarded itself as a class movement, reasoning that farmers and workers were assuming the same material position in society."" An editorial in the Farmers' Alliance spoke of a man working fourteen to sixteen hours a day: ""He is brutalized both morally and physically. He has no ideas, only propensities, he has no beliefs, only instincts."" Pollack sees that as a homespun version of Marx's idea of workers' alienation from his human self under capitalism, and finds many other parallels between Populist and Marxist ideas.
Undoubtedly, Populists, along with most white Americans, had racism and nativism in their thinking. But part of it was that they simply did not think race as important as the economic system. Thus, the Farmers' Alliance said: ""The people's party has sprung into existence not to make the black man free, but to emancipate all men ... to gain for all industrial freedom, without which there can be no political freedom. . . .""
More important than theoretical connections were the Populist expressions of support for workers in actual struggles. The Alliance-Independent of Nebraska, during the great strike at the Carnegie steel plant, wrote: ""All who look beneath the surface will see that the bloody battle fought at Homestead was a mere incident in the great conflict between capital and labor."" Coxey's march of the unemployed drew sympathy in the farm areas; in Osceola, Nebraska, perhaps five thousand people attended a picnic in Coxey's honor. During the Pullman strike, a farmer wrote to the governor of Kansas: ""Unquestionably, nearly, if not quite all Alliance people are in fullest sympathy with these striking men.""
On top of the serious failures to unite blacks and whites, city workers and country farmers, there was the lure of electoral politics-all of that combining to destroy the Populist movement. Once allied with the Democratic party in supporting William Jennings Bryan for President in 1896, Populism would drown in a sea of Democratic politics. The pressure for electoral victory led Populism to make deals with the major parties in city after city. If the Democrats won, it would be absorbed. If the Democrats lost, it would disintegrate. Electoral polities brought into the top leadership the political brokers instead of the agrarian radicals.
There were those radical Populists who saw this. They said fusion with the Democrats to try to ""win"" would lose what they needed, an independent political movement. They said the much- ballyhooed free silver would not change anything fundamental in the capitalist system. One Texas radical said silver coinage would ""leave undisturbed all the conditions which give rise to the undue concentration of wealth.""
Henry Demarest Lloyd noted that the Bryan nomination was subsidized in part by Marcus Daly (of Anaconda Copper) and William Randolph Hearst (of the silver interests in the West). He saw through the rhetoric of Bryan that stirred the crowd of twenty thousand at the Democratic Convention (""we have petitioned, and our petitions have been scorned; we have entreated, and our entreaties have been disregarded; we have begged, and they have mocked when our calamity came. We beg no longer; we entreat no more, we petition no more. We defy them!""). Lloyd wrote bitterly:
The poor people are throwing up their hats in the air for those who promise to lead them out of the wilderness by way of the currency route. . .. The people are to be kept wandering forty years in the currency labyrinth, as they have for the last forty years been led up and down the tariff bill.
In the election of 1896, with the Populist movement enticed into the Democratic party, Bryan, the Democratic candidate, was defeated by William McKinley, for whom the corporations and the press mobilized, in the first massive use of money in an election campaign. Even the hint of Populism in the Democratic party, it seemed, could not be tolerated, and the big guns of the Establishment pulled out all their ammunition, to make sure.
It was a time, as election times have often been in the United States, to consolidate the system after years of protest and rebellion. The black was being kept under control in the South. The Indian was being driven off the western plains for good; on a cold winter day in 1890, U.S. army soldiers attacked Indians camped at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, and killed three hundred men, women, and children. It was the climax to four hundred years of violence that began with Columbus, establishing that this continent belonged to white men. But only to certain white men, because it was clear by 1896 that the state stood ready to crush labor strikes, by the law if possible, by force if necessary. And where a threatening mass movement developed, the two-party system stood ready to send out one of its columns to surround that movement and drain it of vitality.
And always, as a way of drowning class resentment in a flood of slogans for national unity, there was patriotism. McKinley had said, in a rare rhetorical connection between money and flag:
... this year is going to be a year of patriotism and devotion to country. I am glad to know that the people in every part of the country mean to be devoted to one flag, the glorious Stars and Stripes; that the people of this country mean to maintain the financial honor of the country as sacredly as they maintain the honor of the flag.
The supreme act of patriotism was war. Two years after McKinley became President, the United States declared war on Spain.3Embed"

French Narrator:  Ah, the sea. So mysterious, so beautiful. So... uhh... wet.  Our story begins in Bikini Bottom's popular undersea eatery, the Krusty Krab restaurant, where...
Police: Back off! Back off! 
French Narrator: Hey, wait a minute. What is happening?
Mr. Krabs: Please settle down.  We've got a situation in there. I'd rather not discuss 'till me manager gets here.
Female Fish:  Look, there he is.
SpongeBob: Talk to me, Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. It started out as a simple order: a Krabby Patty with cheese. When the customer took a bite, no cheese! 
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, Eugene. I'm going in.  Take it easy, friend. I'm the manager of this establishment.  Everything's gonna be just fine.
Phil: I'm really scared here, man.
SpongeBob:  You got a name?
Phil:  Phil.
SpongeBob:  You got a family, Phil?  Come on, Phil, stay with me. Let's hear about that family.
Phil: I got a wife and two beautiful children.
SpongeBob:  That's what it's all about. I want you to do me a favor, Phil.
Phil: What?
SpongeBob:  Say ""cheese.""  Order up.
All :  Three cheers for the manager! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! Hip! 
SpongeBob: Hooray! Gary! I had that dream again! And it’s finally going to come true!  Today! Sorry about this calendar.  Because today is the grand-opening ceremony for The Krusty Krab 2, where Mr. Krabs will announce the new manager.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Who's it gonna be, Gary? Well, let's ask my wall of 374 consecutive employee-of-the-month awards.

SpongeBob: I have to tell you something, Squidward.
Squidward: Whatever it is, can't it wait until we get to work?
SpongeBob: There's no shower at work.
Squidward: What do you want?
SpongeBob: I just wanted to say I'll be thanking you in my managerial acceptance speech today.
Squidward: Get out! 
SpongeBob: Okay. I'll see you at the ceremony. 
Patrick: That sounds like the manager of the new Krusty Krab 2. Oops. Hold on. Congratulations, buddy.
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks, Patrick. And tonight, after my big promotion, we're gonna party till we're purple.
Patrick: Oh, I love being purple!
SpongeBob: We're going to the place where all the action is.

Perch Perkins: Hello, Bikini Bottom! Perch Perkins here, coming to you live from in front of The Krusty Krab restaurant, for years the only place to get a delicious and mouthwatering Krabby Patty. Until today, that is. That's right, folks. Longtime owner Mr. Krabs is opening a new restaurant called The Krusty Krab 2!  First of all, congratulations, Mr. Krabs. 
Mr. Krabs: Hello. I like money.
Perch Perkins: What inspired you to build a second Krusty Krab right next door to the original?
Mr. Krabs: Money. 
Plankton: Curses! It's not fair. Krabs is being interviewed by Perch Perkins, and I've never even had one customer! 
Karen: Don't get worked up again, Plankton, I just mopped the floors.
Plankton: Oh, Karen, my computer wife, if only I could have managed to steal the secret to Krabs' success, the formula for the Krabby Patty. Then people would line up to eat at my restaurant. Lord knows I've tried. I've exhausted every evil plan in my filing cabinet...from A to Y.
Karen: A to Y?
Plankton: Yeah, A to Y. You know, the alphabet.
Karen: What about Z?
Plankton: Z?
Karen: Z. The letter after Y.
Plankton:  W, X, Y, Z.  Plan Z! Here it is, just like you said.
Karen: Oh, boy.
Plankton:  Oh! Oh! Ohhh! It's evil. It's diabolical.  It's lemon-scented. This Plan Z can't possibly fail!  So enjoy today, Mr. Krabs, because by tomorrow, I'll have the formula. Then everyone will eat at the Chum Bucket, and I will rule the world! All hail Plankton. All hail Plank...!  Ow!
SpongeBob: I'm ready, promotion... I'm ready, promotion...
Plankton:  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob:  Eww, I think I stepped in something. 
Plankton: Not in something, on someone, you twit!
SpongeBob: Oh. Sorry, Plankton.  Are you on your way to the grand-opening ceremony?
Plankton: No, I am not on my way over  to the grand-opening ceremony.  I'm busy planning to rule the world! 
SpongeBob: Well, good luck with that.  I'm ready. Promotion. I'm ready. Promotion.
Plankton: Stupid kid. 
Mr. Krabs: Welcome. Welcome, everyone, to the grand opening of The Krusty Krab 2! 
Mrs. Puff: We paid $9 for this?
Sandy: I paid $10!
Mr. Krabs: Now, before we begin with the ribbon-cutting, I'd like to announce the name of our new manager. 
SpongeBob:  Yay! Yeah! Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah! 
Mr. Krabs: Yes. Well, anyway... The new manager is a loyal, hard-working employee.
SpongeBob :  Yes.
Mr. Krabs: The obvious choice for the job.
SpongeBob:  He's right.
Mr. Krabs: A name you all know. It starts with an S.
SpongeBob:  That's me.
Mr. Krabs: Please welcome our new manager...Squidward Tentacles! 
SpongeBob: Yes! Yeah!  Oh, better luck next time, buddy.  Yeah! All right!  People of Bikini Bottom, as the manager of-
Mr. Krabs: Uh, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hold the phone, folks, I'm getting an important news flash from Mr. Krabs. Go ahead, Mr. K.  I'm making a complete what of myself?  The most embarrassing thing you've ever seen?  And now it's worse because I'm repeating everything you say into the microphone?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, for crying out loud, SpongeBob! You didn't get the job!
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: You... did not... get... the job.
SpongeBob: But... But why?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're a great fry cook, but I gave the job to Squidward because being manager is a big responsibility. Well, let's face it, he's more... mature than you.
SpongeBob: I'm not... mature?
Mr. Krabs: Lad, I mean this in the nicest of ways, but there's a word for what you are, and that word is... now, let's see...
Lenny: Dork?
Mr. Krabs: No, wait, that's not right. Not a dork.
Pearl: A goofball?
Mr. Krabs: Closer, but no, no, no.
Fred: A ding-a-ling.
Jimmy: Wing nut.
Mable: A Knucklehead McSpazatron!
Mr. Krabs: OK, that's enough! Look, what I'm trying to say is, you're just a kid. And to be a manager, you have to be a man. Otherwise they'd call it ""kid-ager."" You understand-ager? I mean, you understand?
SpongeBob: I guess so, Mr. Krabs.
Mr Krabs: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob : I'm ready. Depression. I'm ready. Depression.
Mr. Krabs: Poor kid.
Patrick: Hooray for SpongeBob! Hooray for SpongeBob!
Patrick: Let's hear it for SpongeBob! Hello? Where'd everybody go? Did I miss something? Did you see my butt?
French Narrator: Later that evening...
Plankton: Time to put Plan Z into effect. Starting at the undersea castle of King Neptune.
Squire: Oh, right.  The royal court is now in session. Bring the prisoner forward. 
Neptune: So, you have confessed to the crime of touching the king's crown?
Prisoner: Yes, but...
Neptune: But what?!
Prisoner: But it's my job, Your Highness. I'm the royal crown polisher.
Neptune: Well, then I guess I can't execute you. Twenty years in the dungeon it is.
Mindy: Daddy!  You're free to go.
Crown Polisher: Bless you, Princess Mindy. 
Neptune: Mindy, how dare you defy me?!
Mindy: Why do you have to be so mean?
Neptune: I am the king. I must enforce the laws of the sea.
Mindy: Father, I wish you'd try a little love and compassion instead of these harsh punishments.
Squire: That would be nice. 
Neptune: Squire, clear the room. I wish to speak to my daughter alone.  What is this, Mindy?
Mindy: Your crown?
Neptune: And what does this crown do?
Mindy: It covers your bald spot.
Neptune: It's not bald! It's... thinning. This crown does much more than cover a slightly receding hairline.  No, this crown entitles the one who wears it to be in charge of the sea. One day, you will wear this crown.
Mindy: I'm gonna be bald?!
Neptune: Thinning! Anyway, the point is, you won't wear it until you learn how to rule with an iron fist. Like your father. 
Mindy: Dad, your ""crown""...
Neptune: What the...?  My crown! Aah! Someone has stolen the royal crown!
Plankton:  I got it. I got it! 
Goofy Goober Clock: Hey, all you Goobers, it's time to say howdy to your favorite undersea peanut, Goofy Goober! 
Kids: Howdy, Goofy Goober!
Goofy Goober: Hey, fellow Goofy Goobers. Time to sing.
Goofy Goober: ♪Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah.♪
Goofy Goober and Kids: ♪Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!♪ 
SpongeBob: All right. Get it together, old boy. I know. I'll just stop thinking about it. Hey, you know, I actually feel a little better. I don't even remember why I was sad.
Patrick: Hey, it's the new Krusty Krab 2 manager!  Wow, the pressure's already setting in.
SpongeBob: No, Pat, you don't understand. I didn't get the promotion.
Patrick: What? Why?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs thinks I'm a kid.
Patrick:  What?! That's insane!
SpongeBob: I know.
Patrick: Well, saying you're a kid, it's like saying I'm a kid! 
Waiter: Here's your Goober Meal, sir.
Patrick: I'm supposed to get a toy with this.  Thanks.
SpongeBob:  I'm gonna head home, Pat. The celebration's off.
Patrick: Are you sure?
SpongeBob: Yeah. I'm not in a Goober mood. 
Patrick: Okay, see you.
Waiter:  And here's your Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, sir. 
Patrick: Yum!
SpongeBob: A Triple Gooberberry Sunrise, huh? I guess I could use one of those.
Patrick: Now you're talking. Hey, waiter, we need another one over here.
Waiter:  There you go.
SpongeBob: Ooh! 
Both: Buuurrrp!
SpongeBob: Boy, Pat, that hit the spot. I'm feeling better already.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Waiter, let's get another round over here.  Oh, Mr. Waiter. Two more, please. 
Both: Whoo! 
SpongeBob: Waiter.  Oh, waiter.  Waiter.  Wai-toor.  Waiter!
Waiter:  Why do I always get the nuts?
SpongeBob:  All right, folks, this one goes out to my two bestest friends in the whole world:  Patrick and this big peanut guy! It's a little ditty called...
Both: Waiter!
Waiter:  Hey. Hey, get up. Hey, come on, buddy. I wanna go home. Come on, pal.
SpongeBob:  Oh, my head. 
Waiter: Listen to me. It's 8 in the morning. Go scrape up your friend and get going.
SpongeBob: My friend?  Patrick. Hey, what's up, buddy?  Wait, you said 8:00. I'm late for work. Mr. Krabs is gonna be... Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Now, pay attention, Squidward. As new manager, you've gotta keep a sharp eye out for paying customers. 
Squidward: Yawn.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? King Neptune is riding toward the Krusty Krab at lunchtime! He's got money!
Neptune: Stay in the coach, daughter.  This won't take long.
Mindy: Daddy, please. I think you're overreacting.
Neptune: Silence, Mindy. I know what I'm doing.  Ow! Squire! 
Squire: Yes, Your Highness?
Neptune: Have this pole executed at once.
Squidward: A hundred and one dollars for a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: With cheese, Mr. Squidward, with cheese.
Neptune:  Greeting, subjects. I seek the one known as Eugene Krabs. May he present himself to me at once.
Mr. Krabs: I'm Eugene Krabs, Your Highness. Would you like to order something?
Neptune:  Nay! I'm on to you, Krabs! You have stolen the royal crown, you cannot deny! For, clever as you are, you left one damning piece of evidence at the scene of the crime! 
Mr. Krabs: ""I stole your crown. Signed, Eugene Krabs?!"" 
Neptune: Relinquish the royal crown to me at once!
Mr. Krabs: But... But this is crazy! I didn't do it!
The Phone:  Ahoy, this is Eugene Krabs. Leave a message.
Clay:  Hi, Mr. Krabs. This is Clay, the guy you sold Neptune's crown to. Yeah, I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown. I sold it to a guy in Shell City, and I just wanted to say thanks again for selling me the crown. Neptune's crown.  Which is now in Shell City. Goodbye.
Mr. Krabs: Heh, heh... Don't you just hate wrong numbers?
Neptune: My crown is in the forbidden Shell City?! 
Plankton: Plan Z. I love Plan Z.
King Neptune:  Prepare to burn, Krabs!
Mr. Krabs:  Wait, Neptune! Please, I'm begging you! I ain't a crook! Ask anyone, they'll vouch for me!
King Neptune: Very well, then. Before I turn this conniving crustacean into fishmeal, who here has anything to say about Eugene Krabs?
SpongeBob:  I've got something to say about Mr.  Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, you've come just in time. Please, tell King Neptune all about me.
SpongeBob: I have worked for Mr. Krabs for many years and always thought he was a great boss.
Mr. Krabs: You see? A great boss.
SpongeBob:  I now realize that he's a GREAT BIG JERK! I deserve that manager's job! But you didn't give it to me, because you say I'm a kid. Well, I am 100% man! And this man has got something to say to you.  There, I think I made my point.
King Neptune: Anyone else? No? Well, then. 
SpongeBob: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Ooh! Me pants are on fire! Me underwear's on fire! I'm on fire!  Oh, yeah.
King Neptune: And now, Eugene Krabs,  you... will...
SpongeBob: Wait! I'm flattered you would do this on my account, but being manager isn't worth killing Mr. Krabs over.
King Neptune: Quiet, fool! Mr. Krabs stole my crown, and now it's in Shell City. That's why he must die.
SpongeBob: Doesn't it seem a little harsh to kill someone over a crown?
King Neptune: You don't understand. My crown is a symbol of my king-like authority. And between you and me... my hair is thinning a bit.
SpongeBob: Oh, Your Highness, I'm sure it's not that noticeable... Bald! Bald!
Fred: My eyes!
King Neptune:  All right, all right.
SpongeBob: King Neptune, sir? Would you spare Mr. Krabs' life if I went to get your crown back?
King Neptune:  You, go to Shell City?  No one who's gone to Shell City has ever returned. What makes you think you could? You're just a kid. 
SpongeBob: But I'm not a kid. I can do it.
King Neptune: Run along. I have a crab to cook. 
Mr. Krabs: No! 
SpongeBob: No! I won't let you.
King Neptune: Very well, then. I'll have to fry you both!
Mindy:  Daddy, stop it! Can't you get through one day without executing someone?
King Neptune: Mindy, I told you to stay in the carriage.
Mindy: Where's your love and compassion?  Look at this little guy. He's willing to risk his life to find your crown and save his boss.
King Neptune: But, daughter, I...
Mindy: Please, Father? At least let him try. What have you got to lose? Might I remind you of your special problem?
All: Bald! Bald! Bald!
Fred: My eyes!
King Neptune:  All right. Very well, Mindy. I'll give him a chance. But when your little champion fails to return, I get to splatter this crab all over the walls.
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
King Neptune: And as for you, be back here with my crown in exactly 10 days! 
Patrick: He can do it in 9!
King Neptune: 8!
Patrick: 7!
King Neptune: 6!
SpongeBob & Mr. Krabs: Patrick! 
King Neptune: Six it is, then.
Patrick:  Fi--ve.
SpongeBob: Patrick, shush!
King Neptune: Until then, the crab shall remain frozen where he now stands! 
Mr. Krabs: No, wait! I'm begging you! 
Squidward: Who turned on the AC?  Mr. Krabs! Oh, no, this is terrible! Who's gonna sign my paycheck?
King Neptune: Come along, Mindy.
Mindy: Listen, you guys, the road to Shell City is really dangerous. There's crooks, killers and monsters everywhere! And what's worse, there's a giant Cyclops  who guards the outskirts of the city and preys on innocent sea creatures. Don't let him catch you, because if he does, he'll take you back to his lair, and you'll never be seen again!
Patrick: She's purty, SpongeBob.
Mindy: Here, take this.
SpongeBob: What's in here? 
Mindy: It's a magical bag of winds. I stole them from my father.
Patrick:  You're hot.
Mindy: Once you find the crown, open the bag of winds and you'll be blown back home.
Neptune:  Mindy!
Mindy: I'm coming! Good luck, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Wait! How did you know my name?
Mindy: Oh, I'm gonna be queen of the sea one day. I've learned the names of all the sea creatures.
Patrick: What's my name?
Mindy: That's easy. You're Patrick Star. 
Neptune: Mindy!
Mindy: I gotta go. I believe in you guys.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Mindy.  Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. Patrick, Squidward and I...
Squidward: Pass. 
SpongeBob: Patrick and I...
Patrick: Hi.
SpongeBob: ... are gonna get that crown back and save you from Neptune's wrath. You've got nothing to worry about. Your life is in our hands.  Patrick, let's go get that crown!
SpongeBob: Feast your eyes, Patrick.
Patrick: What is it?
SpongeBob: The Patty Wagon. Mr. Krabs uses it for promotional reasons. Let me show you some of its features. Sesame-seed finish, steel-belted pickles, grilled-leather interior. And under the hood, a fuel-injected French-fryer with dual overhead grease traps.
Patrick: Wow!
SpongeBob: Yeah, wow!
Patrick: Hey, I thought you didn't have a driver's license.
SpongeBob: You don't need a license to drive a sandwich. 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Shell City, here we come!
Plankton: Ding-a-ling. Hey there, old buddy.  Freeze.  One secret formula to go, please. No, no, don't trouble yourself. I'll get it. Well, I'd like to hang around, but I've got Krabby Patties to make... over at the Chum Bucket. Plan Z, I love ya! 
SpongeBob & Patrick: ♪Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!♪
SpongeBob: Fill her up, please.
Floyd: What'll it be, fellas? Mustard... or ketchup?! 
Patrick: Are they laughing at us?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. They're laughing next to us.
Floyd: Where you two dumb kids headed, anyway?
Patrick: Kids?!
SpongeBob: Now, Patrick. For your information, we are not kids. We are men. And we're off to get King Neptune's crown in Shell City.
Floyd and Lloyd: Shell City?
Lloyd: Ain't that the place that's guarded by a killer Cyclops?
SpongeBob: That's right.
Floyd: Lloyd, take off your hat in respect. Respect for the dead!
Floyd: You two dipsticks ain't gonna last 10 seconds over the county line!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? We'll see about that. 
Boat jacker: Out of the car, fellas. 
SpongeBob: How many seconds was that?
Lloyd:  Twelve.
SpongeBob and Patrick: In your face!
SpongeBob: That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!
Patrick: Who's the kid now?
Floyd: They're dead.

Perch Perkins: Perch Perkins here with an incredible news flash. Plankton is selling Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket. How is this possible? Let's find out. 
Plankton: Step right up. Plenty for everybody.
Perch Perkins: Excuse me, Plankton. Perch Perkins, Bikini Bottom News. Can I get a minute?
Plankton: Anything for you, Perch.
Perch Perkins: All of Bikini Bottom wants to know, how did you get the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: Well, Perch, before my dear friend Eugene Krabs was frozen by King Neptune...  I'm sorry. He confided in me a secret wish. ""Sell the Krabby Patty in my absence at the Chum Bucket,"" he said. ""Don't let the flame die out.""  By the way, act now and you get a free Chum Bucket bucket helmet with every purchase. Here you go, Perch. 
Perch Perkins: Thanks.
Plankton: Bucket helmets for everyone!
Man:  My helmet!
Plankton: Karen, baby, I haven't felt this giddy since the day you agreed to be my wife.
Karen: I never agreed.
Plankton: Evil Plan Z is working perfectly. Nothing can stop me now!
Karen: Nothing except SpongeBob and his pink friend.  My sensors indicate that they're going after the crown. If they make it back, Neptune might discover some fingerprints. Tiny fingerprints. Stubby, tiny fingerprints. 
Plankton: Evil Plan Z is way ahead of you, baby. I've already hired someone to take care of those two. He's a vicious, cold-blooded predator!
Dennis:  Sesame seed.
Floyd: Hey, mister, does that hat take ten gallons?

Patrick: Going on.
SpongeBob: Yeah! Moving on. Just keep going.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: Gonna get that crown.
Patrick: Oh, yeah. All right.
SpongeBob: Yeah. Victory.
Patrick: Are we there yet?
SpongeBob: We must be close by now...Patrick, look.  We're doing great! Shell City's only five days away! 
Patrick: By car.
SpongeBob: I wish we still had our car.
Patrick: SpongeBob, look! Our car!
SpongeBob: The key!
Patrick: Where do you think it is?
SpongeBob: There it is, Pat. The key! Now, how are we gonna get it?
Patrick: I know. Walk in and ask him for it.
Thug:  What are you looking at? 
SpongeBob: Patrick, that's a terrible idea.
Patrick:  Sorry.
SpongeBob: I know. I'll go in and create a distraction, and you get the key.
Patrick:  Ooh! Ooh! Wait!, I wanna do the distraction!
SpongeBob: Okay... I guess it really doesn't matter who does the distraction.
Thug in background: You see me walkin' back?!
Patrick: Ahem! Can I have everybody's attention?  I have to use the bathroom.
Boat jacker:  It's, uhh...right over there. 
SpongeBob: Stupid contacts.  Oh, there it is. I better go wash it off. 
SpongeBob:  Patrick! You call that a distraction?!
Patrick:  Well, I had to go to the bathroom.
SpongeBob: Well, I got my hands dirty for nothing.  Patrick, check it out! 
Patrick: Whoa.
Both: Hooray! Bubble party! 
Victor: Hey! Who blew this bubble?!  You all know the rules!
Everybody in the main area of the Thug Tug: All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every able-bodied patron in the bar.
One Patron:  ...bar.
Victor: That's right! So who blew it?!
Victor: So... Nobody knows?
Tough Guy #1: Maybe it was...
Victor: Shut up!  Somebody in here ain't a real man.  You! We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out. Now, everybody line up! DJ! Time for the test.  No baby can resist singing along to this. 
Patrick:  SpongeBob, it's the Goofy Goober theme song.
SpongeBob:  I know! 
Goofy Goober:  ♪Oh, I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah. You're a Goofy Goober, yeah. We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah. Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah!♪
Tough Guy #2: 
Victor:  It was you! You're the baby!
Tough Guy #2: No, no! I only coughed, I swear! 
Victor: DJ! Turn it up louder!
SpongeBob:  Don't sing along, Patrick!
Patrick: I'm trying. Trying so hard. 
Victor: ♪I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah! You're a Goofy Goober, yeah! We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah!♪
Siamese Twins: ♪Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah!♪ 
Victor:  Well, well, well. Which one of you babies was it?!
Siamese Twins:  Uh.. It was him! He did it. I've never even eaten at... ♪Goofy, goofy, goober, goobers, yeah!♪ 
Victor: Well, looks like we got ourselves a double baby! 
SpongeBob: Man, that was a close call.
Patrick: Guess what I got. 
SpongeBob: The key! Shhh...
Squidward: Too bad SpongeBob's not here to enjoy SpongeBob not being here. 
Nat: Morning. 
Squidward: Some people have no taste in headgear.  Huh? Babies too?  Excuse me, miss, but where is everybody getting that horrid headwear?
Evelyn:  Who said that?
Squidward: Down here.
Evelyn:  Oh! Well, I got it at the Chum Bucket. Plankton's giving them away free with every Krabby Patty.
Squidward: Chum Bucket?... Free?... Krabby Patty?... Plankton?... Giving?... With?
Squidward: So you're selling Krabby Patties, eh, Plankton?
Plankton: That's right, Squidward.  And there's a free bucket helmet with every purchase. Care for one?
Squidward: No. You may have hoodwinked everyone else in this backwater town, but you can't fool me. I listen to public radio.
Plankton: And what's that supposed to mean?
Squidward: It means you set up Mr. Krabs. You stole the crown so Neptune would freeze him and you could finally get your stubby little paws on the Krabby Patty formula.  It was you all along. But you made one fatal mistake. You messed with my paycheck. And I'm gonna report you to the highest authority in the land, King Neptune!
Plankton: We'll see about that, Inspector Looselips. 
Karen: Now activating helmet brain-control devices.
Squidward: Huh? What? 
Slaves: All hail Plankton.
Squidward:  What's going on here?
Slaves: All hail Plankton.
Plankton: Seize him, slaves!
Slaves: All hail Plankton.
Squidward: I'm getting outta here! 
Slaves: All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.
Plankton:  Who can stop me now?! Who?!
SpongeBob: Come on, Pat, one more time.
Patrick: Okay.  We're on a baby hunt. And don't think we don't know how to weed 'em out. 
SpongeBob: Weed 'em out!
Patrick: What a jerk. 
SpongeBob: Whoa! The road's getting kinda bumpy here.
Patrick: You know, SpongeBob, there's a lesson to be learned from all of this.
SpongeBob: What's that, Patrick?
Patrick: A bubble-blowing double baby doesn't belong out here in man's country.
SpongeBob: Yeah.  Wait. We blew that bubble. Doesn't that make us a bubble-blowing double baby? 
Patrick: Hey look! Free ice cream!
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! 
Patrick:  How you doing? Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Make mine a chocolate!
SpongeBob: Got you covered.  Two, please.
Old Woman: Certainly. You kids enjoy. 
SpongeBob: Actually, we're men, lady, but thanks.  Okay, Patrick, let's...  Uh, you can let go now. I said, let go, please.  Ugh! Ugh! What is this? What kind of old lady are you!?  Ewwwwww! 
Patrick: Did you get the ice cream? 
SpongeBob: Step on it, Patrick! 
Dennis:  Hmm... 
Victor: Hey!  You may not know it, cowboy, but we got a rule around here about blowing bubbles. 
All Thugs: All bubble-blowing babies will be beaten senseless by every...able-bodied...patron... 
Old Woman: Come on, kiddies, have some ice cream!  I'll let you pet Mr. Whiskers! 
Mr. Whiskers: Meow.
SpongeBob:  Jump for it, Patrick!  Well, we lost our car again.
Patrick: Never mind the car, where's the road?  Road, road, road,  road, road, road, road,  r... Sorry.
SpongeBob: There's the road.  On the other side of this  deep, dark... dangerous...
Patrick:  Hazardous.
SpongeBob: Hazardous...
Patrick:  Monster-infested.
SpongeBob: Yeah, monster-infested...  trench.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look!  Here's the way down. Well, we're not gonna get the crown standing here. On to Shell City.  Hey, look, it's making noise. SpongeBob?  Hey, where are you going?
SpongeBob: I'm going home, Patrick.
Patrick: But what about Mr. Krabs?
SpongeBob: What about us? We'll never survive in that trench. You said it yourself, this is man's country. And let's face it, Pat. We're just...kids.
Patrick: We're not kids!
SpongeBob: Open your eyes, Patrick! We blow bubbles, we eat ice cream. We worship a dancing peanut, for corn's sake! We don't belong out here!
Patrick: We do not worship him!
SpongeBob:  Patrick, You've been wearing the same Goofy Goober Peanut Party underpants for three years straight!  What do you call that!?
Patrick: Worship?  You're right, SpongeBob. We are kids! 
SpongeBob: Pull your pants up, Patrick. We're going home.
Mindy: But you can't go home!
Spongebob: Mindy!
Patrick: Mindy?! 
SpongeBob: How much did you hear?
Mindy: I heard enough.
Patrick: Did you see my underwear?
Mindy: No, Patrick.
Patrick:  Did you want to?
Mindy: Look, guys, you may be kids, but you're the only ones left who can get that crown.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, the only ones left?
Mindy: Things have gotten a lot worse since you left Bikini Bottom.  Or should I say, Planktopolis.
Slaves: All hail Plankton.
Plankton:  No resting! This monument celebrating my glory isn't gonna build itself. Move faster!
SpongeBob: Oh, my gosh! Patrick, look! Plankton's turned everyone we know into slaves.  Squidward, Sandy, Mrs. Puff,  even Gary.
Gary: Meow Plankton.
SpongeBob: Can't your father do something?
Mindy: My father's too distracted by his bald spot to do anything. 
Neptune: Squire, will you hurry? 
Mindy:  So you see, you can't quit. The fate of Bikini Bottom rests in your hands.
SpongeBob: But... But we're just...
Mindy: Hey. It doesn't matter if you're kids. What's so wrong with being a kid, anyway? Kids rule! You don't need to be a man to do this. You just gotta believe in yourself. You just gotta believe! 
SpongeBob: I believe.
Mindy: That's the spirit!
SpongeBob: I believe that...everybody I know is a goner! 
Mindy: Come on, guys.  Guys...  Guys?  Ew!
Narrator: Meanwhile.

Mindy: Guys?  Oh, boy. Think, Mindy, think.  Yup, I guess you're right.  A couple of kids could never survive this journey.  That's why I guess I'll just have to turn you into men. 
SpongeBob: You can do that? How?
Mindy: With my mermaid magic
Horses: 
SpongeBob: Did you hear that, Patrick? She'll use her mermaid magic to turn us into men!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!  We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men! We're gonna be men!
Mindy: Good. Now, let's get started. Close your eyes.
SpongeBob:  Are we men yet?
Mindy: Not yet. Uhhh... spin around three times.
SpongeBob:  I think it's working.
Mindy: Good. Now, keep your eyes shut.  With my mermaid magic and my one tailfin , I command the two of you to turn into men! Open your eyes.
SpongeBob:  I don't feel any...  Oh, my gosh, Patrick, you have a mustache!
Patrick: So do you!
SpongeBob: Wow. 
Mindy: So now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?  Guys!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yeah?
Mindy: I said, now that you're men, can you make it to Shell City?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Heck, yeah!
Mindy: Are men afraid of anything?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Heck, no!
Mindy: And why?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Because we're invincible!  Yeah!
Mindy: I never said that!
SpongeBob:  Patrick?
Patrick: Yeah, buddy?
SpongeBob: Why did we jump over the edge instead of taking the stairs?
Patrick: Bec... well... 
SpongeBob:  Patrick.
Patrick:  Huh. Are we dead?
SpongeBob: ""No, far from it, my friend. We're safe and sound at the bottom of this trench. 
Patrick: The mustaches worked!
SpongeBob: Do you know what that means?  We are invincible!

Dennis: Finally.  I got you right where I want you.
SpongeBob: Can I help you with something, sir?
Dennis: Name's Dennis. I've been hired to exterminate you.
SpongeBob: You're gonna exterminate us?  Listen, junior, you caught me and my friend here in a good mood today, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Step aside, and you won't have to feel the awesome wrath of our mustaches.
Dennis: You mean these?  I thought you still had a piece of salad stuck to your lip from lunchtime.
SpongeBob: They were fake?
Dennis: Of course they were fake! This is what a real mustache looks like. 
Patrick: Is he a mermaid?
Dennis: All right. Enough gab.
SpongeBob: What are you gonna do to us?
Dennis: Plankton was very specific.
SpongeBob: Plankton?
Dennis: For some reason, he wanted me to step on you.
Patrick: Step on us?
Dennis: Yeah! That way you'll never find out that he stole the crown!
Dennis: uhhh... Perhaps I've said too much. 
Patrick: That's a big boot!
Dennis: Don't worry. This'll only hurt a lot!  I love this job! 
Patrick: Bigger boot! 
SpongeBob: Wait, Pat. This bigger boot saved our lives.
Patrick: Yay!
Both: Thank you, stranger.
SpongeBob: Uhh... Stranger?
SpongeBob: IT'S THE CYCLOPS! 
SpongeBob and Patrick: Help us! Help us! Save us, someone!
Patrick: Are we dead?
SpongeBob: I don't think so.  Artificially colored rocks?
SpongeBob: I don't know where we are. What is this?
Patrick: It's some kind of wall of psychic energy. 
SpongeBob: No, Pat, it's a giant glass bowl.
SpongeBob: Hey, there's some fish folk.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, over here! Hey! Hey! Hey, you guys! You guys, hey! Help! Hey! Help! A little help here! We're stuck in this... 
SpongeBob: Wait a second. , and a mariachi band] Those fish are...  dead.  What's he gonna do with us?  Oh, no, he's going for his evil instruments of torture.  Glue? Google eyes? He's making a humorous diorama of..  ... Alexander Clam Bell? Patrick, he's killing sea animals and making them into smelly knickknacks. And I think we're next.
Patrick: You think so? 
SpongeBob: Patrick! No!  The heat is so intense from this lamp that I can't move.
Patrick: Tell me about it.
Cyclops: 
SpongeBob: This doesn't look too good, Patrick.
Patrick:  You mean we're not gonna ♪get the crown, save the town and Mr. Krabs?♪
SpongeBob: I don't even think we're gonna be able to save ourselves, buddy. 
SpongeBob: Thanks.
Patrick: Don't mention it.
SpongeBob: Well, it looks like what everybody said about us is true, Patrick.
Patrick: You mean that we're attractive?
SpongeBob: No, that we're just kids. A couple of kids in way over their heads. We were doomed from the start. I mean, look at us. We didn't even come close to the crown. We let everybody down. We failed.
Patrick: Shell City.
SpongeBob: Yeah, we never made it to Shell City.
Patrick: Shell City.
SpongeBob: Exactly, buddy. Yeah, the place we never got to.
Patrick: Shell City.
SpongeBob: OK, now you're starting to bum me out, Patrick.
Patrick: No, look at the sign.  ""Shell City. Marine gifts and sundries.""
SpongeBob: Shell City is a gift shop? But if this is Shell City, then where's the...? 
Patrick and SpongeBob: Crown!
SpongeBob: Neptune's crown. This is Shell City. Pat, we did make it.
Patrick: Yeah, I guess we did.
SpongeBob:  We did all right for a couple of goofballs. 
SpongeBob:  I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah...
SpongeBob and Patrick: You're a Goofy Goober, yeah...  We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah...  Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah... 
Captain: That's the end of SpongeBob.  Come here, you. 
Captain's Parrot:  Shut up and look at the screen.
Captain: The bird's right. Look!  It be the tear of the Goofy Goobers.
SpongeBob: Hey, we're alive! Let's get that crown.
Patrick: Right. 
SpongeBob: On three, Patrick. Ready? One, two, three.  Hey, it's lighter than I thought. 
Patrick: What's happening?
SpongeBob: I don't know. Look!
Cyclops: Huh?  Uh-oh. 
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick. Let's get this crown back to Bikini Bottom.  Do you still have that bag of winds?
Patrick: I sure do.  Here you go.  What?
SpongeBob: Nothing, nothing... Okay, let's go over the instructions.  Let's see, it says here, ""Step one: Point bag away from home.""
Patrick: OK. 
SpongeBob: ""Step two: Plant feet firmly on ground.""
Patrick: Right! 
SpongeBob: ""Step three: Remove string from bag releasing the winds
Patrick: Check. 
SpongeBob: Well, that seems simple enough. Point bag away from home, feet firmly on ground, pull string, releasing the winds. All right, let's do it for real.
Patrick: Uh, SpongeBob? 
SpongeBob: No, no, stop! 
Patrick: I was bad, I'm sorry! Please, bag. I'm sorry, I just thought... It was a mistake! 
SpongeBob: Oh, no. How will we ever get back to Bikini Bottom now?
David Hasselhoff: I can take you there. 
SpongeBob: Who are you?
David Hasselhoff: I'm David Hasselhoff.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
SpongeBob: So where's your boat?
David Hasselhoff: Boat? 
SpongeBob: Go, Hasselhoff!
Patrick: Next stop, Bikini Bottom!
Bikini Bottom Residents: All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton.
Plankton: Well, Krabs, you know what today is?  Sorry about this calendar.  March 14. Wait, that's not right. It should say ""The day that Krabs fries!""  Guess who's here.
SpongeBob: Hooray for Hasselhoff! Nothing can stop us now.
Patrick: Unidentified object off the hindquarters.
SpongeBob: It looks like...  Bigger boot. But how?
SpongeBob: Ah! Dennis!
Dennis: Did you miss me?
Plankton:  This is the best seat in the house. All right, Neptune, let's get it on!
Neptune: Eugene Krabs, your six-day reprieve is up! And it is time for you to die!
Mr. Krabs:  Please, I didn't do it.
Neptune: There is nothing else I can do.
Mindy: You can give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time.
Neptune: Except give SpongeBob and Patrick a little more time... What?  Mindy, will you butt out? I won't have you stalling this execution.
Mindy: Stalling? I'm not stalling anything.
Neptune: Yes, you are.
Mindy: No, I'm not.
Neptune: Yes, you are. You're doing it right now.
Mindy: I'm stalling.
Neptune: Yes.
Mindy: Stalling?
Neptune: Stalling!
Mindy: Stalling.
Neptune: Stalling!
Plankton: Oh, boy.
Dennis: Now, where were we? 
SpongeBob: Patrick, run.
Patrick: No, I'm tired of running. If we run now,  we'll never stop...  Run, SpongeBob! 
David Hasselhoff: Ooh! Take it easy back there, fellas.
Patrick: SpongeBob, be careful.
Dennis: Come on, kid, give it up.  Dennis always gets his man. 
SpongeBob: Never!  Yeah! I did it!
Dennis:  You got guts, kid.  Too bad I gotta rip them out of you.
SpongeBob: I don't know what Plankton's paying you,  but if you let us go, I can make it worth your while. 
Dennis: It's gonna take a lot more than five... What is this?
SpongeBob: That, sir, is five Goober Dollars. Legal tender at any participating Goofy Goober-- ... I got bubbles. Fun at parties. 
Dennis:  My eyes! 
Patrick: I got you, SpongeBob. 
SpongeBob: Thanks, buddy.  Uh, thanks a lot.
Dennis:  That's it! I'm through messin' around! See ya later, fools!  Huh?  Ahhhhhhhh! 
Patrick: See ya.
Mindy: So you think... I'm...  stalling.
Neptune: Gah! Where am I, in Crazytown? I have had enough of this nonsense!  You are to wait in the carriage until the execution is done!
Mindy:  But, Daddy...
Neptune: Now! 
Mindy:  No, no, no! Oh, SpongeBob, wherever you are, you better hurry.
David Hasselhoff:  Okay, fellas, this is where you get off. Bikini Bottom's directly below.
SpongeBob: But we'll never be able to float down in time.
David Hasselhoff: Who said anything about floating? 
Houston Voice: Initiating launch sequence.
SpongeBob & Patrick: What the? 
SpongeBob: Did you see that?
Patrick: The control. 
David Hasselhoff: All hands on deck. 
Houston Voice: Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight...
Neptune: Eugene Krabs, the time has come... 
Mindy:  No!
Plankton:  Yes!
Houston Voice: ...six, five...
Neptune: ... for you...
Mindy:  No!
Plankton:  Yes!
Houston Voice: ...three, two...
Neptune: ...to fry.
Mindy:  No-o-o!
Plankton:  Yes!
Houston Voice: ... one. 
SpongeBob & Patrick: Ahhhhhhh!
Mr. Krabs:  No! 
David Hasselhoff: You done good, Hasselhoff. You done...  Ow. 
SpongeBob: Hooray! We made it!
Patrick: We made it! 
Neptune: My crown! My beautiful crown! 
Mindy:  SpongeBob? Patrick? I knew you could do it! 
Plankton:  Oh, yes. Well done, SpongeBoob.
SpongeBob:  Sorry to rain on your parade, Plankton.
Plankton: Oh, don't worry about me. My parade shall be quite dry under my umbrella! 
SpongeBob, Mindy, and Patrick: Umbrellaaaaaaaa? 
Mindy: Daddy, no!
Plankton: Daddy, yes! 
Neptune:  All hail Plankton. 
People: All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. All hail Plankton. 
Patrick: SpongeBob, what happened?
SpongeBob: Plankton cheated.
Plankton: Cheated?  Hold on there, baldy.  Oh, grow up. What, you think this is a game of kickball on the playground? You never had a chance to defeat me, fool! And you know why?
SpongeBob: Because you cheated?
Plankton: No, not because I cheated! Because I'm an evil genius. And you're just a kid. A stupid kid! 
SpongeBob: I guess you're right, Plankton. I am just a kid.
Plankton: Of course I'm right. Okay, Neptune, time to kill.
SpongeBob: And you know, I've been through a lot in the past six days, five minutes, twenty-seven-and-a-half seconds. And if I've learned anything during that time, It's that you are who you are.
Plankton: That's right. Okay, Neptune...
SpongeBob: And no amount of mermaid magic...  ...or managerial promotion...  ...or some other third thing... can make me anything more than what I really am inside: A kid.
Plankton: That's great. Now, get back against the wall.
SpongeBob:  But that's okay.
Plankton: What? What's going on?
SpongeBob: Because I did what everyone said a kid couldn't do. I made it to Shell City, and I beat the Cyclops, and I rode the Hasselhoff, and I brought the crown back.
Plankton: All right, we get the point.
SpongeBob: So, yeah, I'm a kid.  And I'm also a goofball. And a wing nut. And a Knucklehead McSpazatron!
Plankton:  What's going on here?
SpongeBob: But most of all, I'm... 
Plankton: Okay, settle down. Take it easy.
SpongeBob: I'm... I'm...
Plankton: What the scallop?!
SpongeBob:  ♪I'm a Goofy Goober! Rock!♪  ♪You're a Goofy Goober! Rock! We're all Goofy Goobers! Rock! Goofy, goofy, goober, goober! Put your toys away. Well, all I gotta say when you tell me not to play, I say no way. No way! No, no freaking way! I'm a kid, you say, when you say I'm a kid I say, Say it again and then I say thanks. Thanks! Thank you very much! So if you're thinking that you'd like to be like me, go ahead and try. The kid inside will set you free! Humala bebuhla zeebuhla boobuhla humala bebuhla zeebuhla bop!

Fish:  I'm free. I've been freed!
Plankton: What?  No!  My precious helmets!
Squidward:  Ha!
Mrs. Puff:  Hoo!
Sandy:  Yee-haw!
Gary:  Meow. 
Plankton: His chops are too righteous! The helmets can't handle this level of rock 'n' roll! Karen, do something! Karen?  All right, that's the last straw! Neptune, I command you to...
Mindy: Here you go, Daddy.
Plankton: I better get outta here. 
Sandals: Look, it's the wizard who saved us.
Plankton: Out of my way, fools.  Ow! Ow! Oooooooow! 
Plankton:  Come on, I was just kidding. Come on, you guys knew that, didn't you? With the helmets and the big monuments...Wasn't that hilarious, everybody?  I will destroy all of you! 
Neptune: Well, Mindy, I have to admit, you were right. Your compassion for these sea creatures proved a most admirable trait. Without it, I would have never again seen my beloved crown. I think you're going to make a fine ruler of the sea one day. Now, let's go home. 
Mindy: Daddy, haven't you forgotten something?
Neptune: What? Oh, yeah. Eugene Krabs, I forgot to unfreeze you. 
Mr. Krabs: What the...?
Neptune: I guess I had it set to ""real boy"" ending. 
Mr. Krabs: Yippee!
Neptune: Oh, I'm sorry for falsely freezing you, Krabs. And may I say, sir, you are a very lucky fellow to have in your employment such a brave, faithful, and heroic young lad. Where is he, anyway?
SpongeBob: I'm up here. 
Patrick: I'm on it. 
Neptune: Go to him now, Krabs. Embrace him. 
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, I'm sorry I ever doubted ye. That's a mistake I won't make again.
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs, you old soft-serve. 
Mr. Krabs: And now, SpongeBob, I'm gonna do something that I should've done six days ago. Mr. Squidward! Front and center, please.  I think we all know who rightfully deserves to wear that manager pin. 
Squidward: I couldn't agree more, sir.
Harold: Hooray for SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Wait a second, everybody. There's something I need to say first. I just don't know how to put it.
Squidward: I think I know what it is. After going on your life-changing journey, you now realize you don't want what you thought you wanted. What you really wanted was inside you all along.
SpongeBob: Are you crazy?  I was just gonna say that your fly is down!  Manager! This is the greatest day of my life! 
Captain: You know. David Hasselhoff is a great artist.
Usher: Excuse me, sir. You folks have to leave.
Captain: What? Say that again, if you dare. 
Usher: You folks have to leave.
Captain: Okay.

Itadias,Jadon Nutlea,"1 ContributorI Know What You Want Lyrics
In a world full of hatred, here comes Perseu
Making tracks out of clay like Zeus, this sorbet
Alleyways, Joe Chill, make heroes out of my prey
Here nuclear winter fall, bitch it’s D-day
Yo yo, you here that cough cough cough
Put on the mask, 6 feet then back off
Hold up wait, already been a year
Brandon this late to make great premiere
Got that, sick flow the devil paid
And I, split rows for me, make way
Got that motor mouth like D. Rickles
And I love rim like vehicles
See my goal is to grow on a bigger scopе
The closest label is Intеrscope
When I sign, get dimes, you know it’s time
Boutta reck them big like dropping soap
Concentrate make my mark on the concrete
I crossed the fleet of peeps tryna beat and cheat
Take my seat and take my suite, it’s sweet
Sweep the feet and meet the face of me
Man I got a big ego, I want a portrait
Just started the match and they forfeit
Diamond rings big enough to put you in orbit
The genius in my head sees big things like fortunes
I sell my tracks like crack and fiends export it
Government sees it as illegal, deport it
If I wore ice and chains, I’d probably be donned a master
Why be an alter boy when you can be the fucking pastor
This is a warm up bitch and I already did my stretches
Love my lazy songs even though they early sketches
Fetching for fame but they already say I’m precious
Already said the winners but my name they didn’t mention
It’s my intention to make your hearts fucking throbbing
Filling up your brain like covid tests and fucking swabbing
These rappers in the toilet, nature is fucking calling
They scared to go up with me so they album fucking stalling
Bitch I’m thee stallion, savage mode on, call the battalion
Mobbing up fools with my homie Jason the Italian
These rappers have a passion, some of them are talented
But I’m the only one that they call the rapscallion
Take out the cannon, you best believe I’m wilding out
Carry my bags, heavy as bowling, I’m striking out
And these kids, these adults, even granny finding out
That I’m the generation’s best when I’m fucking grinding out (it goes)
Baby if you give it to me, I’ll give it to you, I know when to drop
I got that next damn project cooking up in the kitchen
Feel friction while they listen to bitches feel so smitten
Shit's hot, let me put on my mittens
Ambition is a nice addition so please pitch in
I tired of rapping alone, I’m looking for some writtens
Ay, look I'm looking for some writtens like
You might also like
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it

Yeah, hey

Wake Me Up Before You Go Go,The Eighties Orchestra,"54 Contributors30,000 Word Rap Song (World Record) Lyrics

Please, this shit's so fuckin' hard
Helluva Beats
Yeah, ayy, ayy

Thirty-thousand words in a rap
That's a first, and, in fact, that's the most in the world on a track
Yeah, I've been searchin' the map
For like any other person who could work it like that
Do it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast
I'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that
Play me a beat, it gets turned into ash
If I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash
Ayy, hold up, wait
When I'm on the track, I make no mistakes
I can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours
Fuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks
I go UK, then I make so many pounds
Everybody think I'm overweight
Gettin' bread, see me eatin'
But I gotta go in, better hold my plate
Ooh, ooh, gotta switch up
I'm so godly, I'm the bishop
Now these haters wanna link up
My bars make them get the hiccups
So I had to run it up real quick
Freestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick
Everything I do is real big
'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit
Nowadays, they write me and I don't write it back
See my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath
Swear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed
Do the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at
Hey, movin' on, gotta find a team
Earnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans
All these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid
I'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats
Pioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson
I was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn
All these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin
Until I fall off next year, I'ma be arrogant
Yeah, I'm runnin' all this shit, run it up
Yeah, you know that I be comin' up for a hun'ed bucks
At the start, all I wanted was like thirty-thousand hits
Got bored, add a couple zeroes for the shits
Why not? Look what I got, look what I bought
Camera is my true eye, I'm a side-clause
Shoes, they go too high, only high-tops
Fuck yeah, I'm the new guy, what am I on?
Come in, Jaden Smith, I'm a motherfuckin' icon
Boy, I'm too cold, I don't even have on my ice on
Too lit, I don't even have the mic on
And I'm too bright, I don't even have the lights on
Better wait up
Shit's too easy, like a layup
And my bitch too entertainin'
See the note, you gotta stay up
Takin' bets on that I'll fail
It's time to pay up
Now you tryna hide your face
I'm pretty sure that that ain't make-up, uh
I'm droppin' hits and gettin' world records
Who's your favorite artist, 'cause I'm sure better?
Well, maybe not, but I tried, though
Post Malone, I go psycho
Leave you a stink, like a rhino
'Cause I rap beef, no gyro
And I rhyme fast and I rhyme slow
Turned my L's into W's; typo
Uh, hop into the track
Give you the love and you give it right back
Ten different flows I be spittin', some trap
And some other shit get in it's get on the map
Done this for like a year, and now, my writing's clear
I've been gettin' respect, 'cause now I am here
And I'm here to stay, did you hear me say
""I'm not here to play""?
""He got a flow and a voice now
I remember when he chokin' a boy out
But he's back in, showin' no choice now
Don't you know that he's gonna destroy now?""
So I'm gonna get there, and I know how
Got these beats, I be blarin' 'em so loud
When we talk about bitches and money, this shit is so funny
My parents are so proud, damn
I'm startin' to try
Tryin' the shots at it, look at the ground and see stars in the sky
Drawin' the line
All of you rappers are dizzy, I can see the stars in your eyes
You're probably high
If you think that you compare to me, it must be part of the lines
Copyin' guys
You better send all those beats back to Future, like Marty McFly
Thirty-thousand words on a track, lil' bitch
Now these people turn my vid on and react, lil' bitch
Know I got the clout, I got the stats, lil' bitch
And you givin' me a headache, where's the Advil, bitch?
But I'm doin' all I can, and I did it in the past-tense
Makin' all this money up off of YouTube, off me AdSense
Money up off of YouTube, off AdSense
All of you are wack, that's a fact, I'ma rap then
And I rap, huh, I'm a laptop
Eminem holds the world record for ""Rap God""
1.6K words
Though, we already have that topped
And we'll do it for another hour
And I'm underrated and I'm underpowered
My bars are so filthy, uh
All of y'all need to take another shower
For every fan, there's a hundred doubters
And they let me know up in the comments
But you know that we ain't done
'Cause I gotta talk my nonsense
And I gotta keep it clean, uh
Do exactly what my mom says
And I know when they headed for the top
And we still be makin' progress
I can spit bars for nine months
Then deliver you a new life
Yeah, we eatin' in this bitch, uh
All y'all better take a huge bite
And I didn't even write that shit
'Cause I freestyle, you still like that shit
See my video, press 'like' on it
That subscribe button? Better wipe that shit
I'm getting tired of this beat
I think it's time to change it
'Cause I'll spaz on trap
Old school boom-bap, you name it
Think of that as a intro
Now we get into the meat of it
This some shit you didn't see comin'
I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think of it!
You might also like

Heh, ayy!
Ayy, ayy
Uh, switch up
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy

Look out the window, see past it, but we're faintin' reflections
You never laugh like you used to, you've got fainter expressions
You headin' down the wrong path and they changin' directions
Maybe don't mention 'bout how I made me your blessin'
And lately, I question the shit that was taught to me
I'm awkwardly stoppin' these conversations
Hey, how long you waitin' till the day you wake up and thank God you made it?
I don't like to dwell, but man, I gotta say it, don't like my songs, but you still gotta play it
Don't like your road, just N.W.A., Dr. Dre it
Stop contemplatin' and stop complainin'
And recreate it, actually, don't recreate it, be creative
Reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
Living a life of pain just to alleviate it
When you haven't used nothing but distractions to really take it
Yeah, maybe they'll change when they see we made it
We headin' onto new platforms and leavin' the basics
Uh, my creative process is making progress
Despite my background, I haven't gotten to playin' lacrosse yet
Don't you know we got a good thing goin'?
I've been watchin' all these shows while I could be showin'
I've been creeping up on the door, so dangerous
You looking at statistics, while I figure how I'm changin' them
I done learned so many things in my past life
Now I don't give a single shit about the rap life
That's nice, ain't it? That's nice to be given advice when I paint it
Have twice much the fame, and
I can't even comprehend that much in the future
Hatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor
Enter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder
Stealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter
Procrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer
No willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser

Sittin' alone at 3 AM
Chillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend
Man, this shit is too wild, I ""must behave, Ben""
That's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when
I'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence
Accomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?
-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me
Luckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me
I hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it
I hope that one day, you'll see we made it
No, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it
I'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest
That is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'
I'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'
I'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside
Guessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind
And I'm in time
-Workin' all my life, get that in line
I'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out
Nobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline
I'm on the incline, I'm on the incline
Stay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine
I'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline
Nobody can really understand how my shit climb

Have I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet
I'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead
I stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous
Who is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?
Why the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do
I don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, ""Bye"", to you
Hey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do
You have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue
You gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset
Set headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead
I guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed
Impressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said
But I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song
Do right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron
You try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes
Some straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline

Water break
I got a lot to say
It's been eleven minutes so far
Actually, it hasn't, it's been shorter

How can
I have a believable meaning
When all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury
Nobody seen it or  greet it?
But what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be
And it's in inconceivable dreaming
I know it's so unbelievable, being
Stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
They givin' me something, I ended up leaving
They givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'
No positive side, ended up seeing
What life could be like from a  different lead in
Thank God for a cover zone
So I know when and where to cross it
All over the place
I'm surprised I haven't lost it

Yeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh
Livin' to the max now
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background
And the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down
Go till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out
After, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out
But I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout

Okay, it's time to go fast
So sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it
About time, but maybe you're mad I said it
You gon' pay attention, cash or credit?
I have to let it go back a second
I have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit
Now we're back in the middle of the track and fed it
Mix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it
We moved on, walked past the exit
Want you to come back and pass a message
-Never pack bags and trash, you left it
Kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
Money, never am glad I spent it
If I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it
If you ever feel bad or sad, accept it
Think back to the track and the rap that Ben did
Yeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it
If this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus
I'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this
Voice is more powerful than a million instruments
Suddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else
People want me to grow because of you
But I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better
Than the people that never had trust in me
Yeah, uh

And I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah
Livin' to the max now, uh
Yeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud
I'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background
And the music and how my rap sounds

Speak up, and they're messing with the track now
People are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short
Looking back at you when you're missing all the cash now
And I'm mad at the fact that
I'm not in my right mind
Meant to be a half-decent rapper
But I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
Lookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find
Lookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
I find so much life
I wonder why I can't just find mine
Got so many confusing questions
So much knowledge, I can't use the lessons
I'm emerging out with a new profession
I'ma do the best with my new perfection
And I'm doin' it
I'm moving onto this future shit
These hooligans are complete fools in that
They just don't understand that I am through with it
Improvin' it, I'm improvin' it
I got my brain, and I'm usin' it
And I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'
And makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits
You're clueless
Ninety percent of y'all ignorant
Keeping your minds oh-so limited
Get off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out
Seeming so close, I can picture it now
Success in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now
Envisioning deeper ambitions, and now
I'ma get to it, that is what living's about

Uh, God!
Uh
My voice is gone already, shit
Alright, ayy, ayy, ayy

Think I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches
Adolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us
Makin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die
Makin' you hang your head low, but say, ""Reach for the skies""
Life is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies
I'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes
I feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
With all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try
Yeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply
Tryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry
Fuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, ""Why?""
So I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
Like, oh well, I can say that I tried
Hopped into life and then I stayed for the ride
So many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside
And I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn
This reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.​
I'm screamin', ""Hi"" to the sky up with a smile on my face
Now I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace
All of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place
Swept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace
And now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet
I used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic
Recently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it
See my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
That's the type of shit that makes you think back
To simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds
Before reality could ground us, we would live in the skies
And as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)
Man, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist
I felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist
And now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit
You only look at what you got once you see that it's lost
And life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
Don't understand rappers braggin', ""I got that paper on me""
Man, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me
So what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?
To me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money
Rain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study
And write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn
Like Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize
These Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's
This is a natural high
I see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies
I wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried
They say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie
They think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid
As DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive
Threw out half of my album, it wasn't good enough
Shit, I mean it still isn't good enough
I'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt
But I guess I am not full enough, damn
I swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel
Man, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal
Man, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real
Thirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel
Yeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement
Yeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent
Every day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest
And if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted
Most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me
So when I die, I know I left us with something to leave
So when I wake up in the morning with something to see
Yeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be

Benny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said
If you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-
Many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
Got iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence
Yeah, I know I'm way too cocky
But I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out
So when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better
That's benefit of the doubt
I've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom
It's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often
And I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around
Always stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-
Yeah, this is freedom of speech
Tryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace
Sacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree
Opportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-
Nah, I'm just tryna find some clarity
Apparently, it all has to do with popularity
There will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to
What is carefully being prepared to me
Sometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity
I'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least

Giving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see
Everyone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy
'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case
Shot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass
Off of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say
And at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say
So let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages
Seeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand
That I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest
Entertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize
Start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
That's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'
With the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon
But I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'
Limited ability with little humility
But whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me
I'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history
Tryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me
Tryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg
You beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me
Showin' up on your device, control/option/delete
Consider myself elite, measure myself in retweets
I be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me
Instead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout
I'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house
Tryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch
I'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out
Into reality, in normality actually happily
Found myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?
'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing
Nothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing
Not complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it
Love sleepin' and just usin' the internet
But my time is limited, and I better figure this
Before I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips
And let me just tell you what I have came to do
Tryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to
Tryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo
And say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through
And if a major record label is looking at me
I'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats
I can rap fast, and rap slow
I may make mistakes but everyone, has, so
I'm like MJ back when he had the afro
Also, I'm not black, so... maybe not
But before everyone gets angry, stop
I'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block
All the people who keep on going crazy off
'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got
A lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker
With some dominant teachers
I deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers
I'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager
They be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it
To know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid
So when you're nearin' this, please let me know
When I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go
Hear the metronome combined in the compilation
To unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation
But that is just a dream, and probably a combination
Of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
But when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game
I was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name
But when you think about it, it is all insane
What can be created from chemicals in this brain
But when you look at me, you lackin' respect
When I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest
Has in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step
Until I'm on the same stage, and you have it again
But, but when you think about the hall-of-fame
You think about how people used to sit and call you names
And you check and wonder if it will be all the same
Step back into reality, it all remains, damn

Alright, I just spilled water on my computer right now
On my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit
Hold on, uh
Goddamn it

My lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean
This is off the top, I don't need to use no machines
Hold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever
But I am very clever, okay, okay
I'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too
These are some shit' that you can drink to
But drink water unless you're of age
You know what I'm sayin'? Ayy

Okay, okay
Uh
Uh
Ayy

I feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous
-Most of humanity's made of idiots
I barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?
You think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?
Please... what I do is barely poetry
There's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me
But still consider me confident
Still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
But honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably
It is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling
Into awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'
It's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening
It's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake
I close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away
Yeah, we're just tryna find that great escape
To get away from how we're living life day-to-day
Some people find it in a drink or in a cup
Or in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love
But all I know is that it's tough
And all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much

I'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?
These kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players
That shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low
Got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show
What I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype
And I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life
-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights
Ahead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night
-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass
-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast
Remember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it
And say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected
Take a deep breath, 'cause I need that
Most of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast
My bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors
You want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards
Say that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this
I'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit
Tryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day
'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?
I'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go
I'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own
I'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit
Reason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch
Meaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it
Pleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it
Flow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break
We all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day
'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it
You know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments
All of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em
Start a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it
Breaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it
I know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'
Under the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'
I found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it
I try to go slow, but it don't work
-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure
You're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners
This is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre
Hah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough
Forgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up
My chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us
And so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up
-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back
Remember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that
Hit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming
Listen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding
We run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through
These lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true
'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred
Shoutout to Didac and Momo and the others
Shit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family
Shoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me
Yeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh
Better trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack
Started off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me
In the past, I never anticipated what there would be
And see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now
See ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now

It's on now
Oh shit, I'm almost out of water
This is a hard- this a- real challenge
This like, physically difficult, ayy

When I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra
Now everybody telling me I don't perform enough
My math teacher told me that I'd never be shit
And now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula
I got the formula, I got the formula
You got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy
People always asking Ben, ""Why you record so much?""
I got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up

Formula, like I'm Mr. Krabs
I change and transform it up, you stuck in the past
Yeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab
Uh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag
And now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'
People love to criticize me for the life I've had
They make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'
I make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy
Uh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie
And I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami
Wanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'
Tryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies
Ayy, still saying, ""Who would'a thought?"", like, who would'a guessed it?
Haven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing
If you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:
Want the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook

Ayy, they doubt a fucker with a dream
Looking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah
Looking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens
Serpent's told you, ""No,"" and it's like nothing's as it seems
God damn, I guess I really thought he was the man
I guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham
All that cash he stocked was from a scam
All the views he got was from some spam
I've been living like, ""Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?
Why ain't he just sticking to the plan?
How has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?""
I don't get it, I don't really understand
I've been living like, ""Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram
I'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand
Next to all these average fucking sad duds?""
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one

Yeah
Hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one
Ayy
Just because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup
Uh, uh, uh
Feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
And so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he

'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine
I've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap
That shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now
I'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out
How did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday
And I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away
But I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun
So I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one

By now, if you're still watching this shit
You are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit
But we ain't over, we ain't done, though
Am I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?
Well, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K
While all you sit around, I would rather work than play
Lyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae
Hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

That was actually a pretty good bar
I just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this
Ayy, ayy
You know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh

Sometimes, I don't know what to think
Sometimes, I don't know what'll
Make it okay, make it okay
I'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy

Uh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering
All these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
All accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
Often is the result of falling under consciousness
You'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives
You're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie
And I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty
Fearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me
No, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever
But in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better
But I don't ever
Want to go to show, just one mo' letter
I'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades
And get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid
Uh... my life is so unusual
To most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable
Can't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral
I'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
Uh, but you know that I'm capable
You know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available
Feeling so unique and I think it's not explainable
No one hears my lyrics, and says, ""OMG, relatable!""
No, that's not what I'm here to give
Been waiting years for this, you're about to experience
Something that I've spent time, money and thought on
Learned about all the times money had thought wrong
Kinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long
I ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot
-Out on the inside, see me on the outside
Always think I'm positive, and never see the downsides
It's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it
Get your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it

Okay
Okay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in
Thirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro
Fuck

Yeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware
I'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared
I'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs
But y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared
I got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it
Shoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip
Man, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders
It's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip
Damn, I got a crazy ass work ethic
Blocked out south east and west, leave in one direction
I finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it
Fuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection
We all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons
Like a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'
Wanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly
And I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar
Can't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'
Yeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person
I base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-
-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain

You keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high
Wanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy
Can't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize
How it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize
And analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed
And take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise
America is very nice, but I'd like to see the world
But I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

In a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends
Crazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens
They be tens or more, they be tens or more
I like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors
It's free speech, I can say what I want
But these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk
They don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter
I get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh
Motherfucker, I'ma live for the right time
Fuck that, I'ma live for the moment
Sitting here in the middle of the night time
My mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'
Damn, I've been livin' in a headache
Bitches never listenin', they saying that they ready
But I can never believe them
Got these goals and they can never achieve 'em
How can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?
Damn, that's a lot of shit to think about
Suddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering
What I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out
Made some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh
Got these dreams that I'm livin' out
In my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses
That I never pictured, wow, damn, damn
This beat's way too holy to rap over
Mental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower
Your raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance
Like a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'
Ooh, but I have got somethin' to tell you
I ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you
Speakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life
Watching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might
Be on that stage right beside all these players
Shit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers
I'll prove it in music I use to influence
I do this way harder than people assumin'
Resumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'
That puts me to be in the view of the hidin'
I do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me
No matter what I do, they just mistake the
Reason I'm flowin', the reason I start up
Not just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks
And- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place
Most to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste
I'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh
I just need a home run, I already loaded bases
I have got so many cases
Been visiting, living in so many places
Experiences that I made me to Emmy
Ben, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me
Be me, I ain't greedy or needy
Believe me, I just want to be on your TV
Get on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase
Damn, yeah, I've been looking at their space
And, one day, I'll be there
I know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared

I've been waiting like thirty-thousand years
Tryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear
I'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career
I'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here
Now I earned it, and I'm here to stay
I'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play
Not even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame
Not really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day
I don't know- I look at the future nostalgically
I'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me
Undoubtably know how to be what I am about to be
To say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me

Recently, I have been feeling alienated
My songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em
But, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different
Hate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it

People say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
All will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene
Y'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty
Promise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?
Trapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages
When I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and
I'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song
Move along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
Who could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?
One great tongue, I am that one great one
On vacation, I vacate to a location
Far away from where people just may run
A light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun
Oh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young
I can murder this beat with no gun, go run
I've too many problems to handle, here, hold one
I just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks
And now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk
Was a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station
Playing it, making it just get to the worst
My head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure
I'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth
And now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it
Now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah

Good rappers never get to see the light of day
But when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away
I'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?
I'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business
Nobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit
Know I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, ""Oh, this kid is big""
Know how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen
Till I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah
And when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story
God ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory
Not visually, typically, the original me
So unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally
Damn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked
And I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track
And I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real
Whenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel
So different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it
Time to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it
I always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me
One path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B

I wrote that one a long time ago
That was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again
But you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty
I- actually... classic!

We just living in the solar system
One big world here to hold the wisdom
One big jail to control the victims
We're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm
A voice in writing and a choice deciding
Whether or not to follow what the boys are likin'
What the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to
Think about who you are, and it's so true
Think about the people who you think have really known you
Do they really know you? Do you even know you?
Damn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet
Sometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be
And lately, it seems to make the extremes
So prominent and dominant in making big dreams
I'm seeing aliens scream
When I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing
But I'm just tryna make it in life
Fuck you to people who be saying it like
I ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike
I'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite
The fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy
And I know a lot of people would consider me early
I'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
Tryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens
I'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting
I just see all the people living and burning
So be free, time to be a little bit nervous
It don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing
And I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it
Guessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid
So I'll see ya 'round, underachievers
Hop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man

So basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me
I'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z
And, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three
But now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?

I've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks
Manipulating their audience to catch that hook
They'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-
You can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha
But no shots fired, though
Nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
I mean... look at Fox News
That's the whole premise of their entire show
But no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist
Makin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
I got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch
But I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids
I got time! Maybe a little too much of it
But you know that I'm tryna move up a bit
People look at me and say my potential has
Got a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it
So fire, can't handle me with oven mitts
Underground, blessed if you discovered it
Flow is so unique, I got so much to do
Not like any other kid

Ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

Wait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this
Picture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious
Tryna make my moves while they huge and they famous
I knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded
Now, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up
Now I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up
Now I'm fly and my opponents better catch up
I get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up
I-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence
In tracks I was makin', I had to be patient
Everybody said that shit was trash, and they were right
But I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night
Now I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night
Everybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite
So I'm like, ""Okay... no way""
Yeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play
I'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone
Ball so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom
YouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song
I'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on

Like, ayy, yo, what you say, though?
Yeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though
Yeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low
You know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt

So I'm like okay, nah, no way
When it comes to that shit, man, I don't play
If you ask me how I got it I will say
I got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh

Damn
Some of these
Are too slow and also too fast
Whatever

I'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus
Pull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage
Hey now, yo, what's the play now?
I'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground
Yeah, I remember all them days I would stay down
20K's chillin' in my PayPal
So what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now? Nothin'
Best in my town and that's no discussion
Humble beginnings, ain't humble, we winnin'
If I wanna brag, that's my humble decision
Everything I do is goin' off
So if I wanna freestyle, then you better know the cost, ayy

I think she blocked me
Damn
There's no more water, I'm literally about to die

I think she blocked me on the Instagram
I need to know, what did I do? I guess I missed your plan
Me, I'm just searchin' for that truest shit, where is it, man?
I'll never know, just wanted you to help me understand
I need some closure because, truthfully, I give a damn, I give a damn
Plenty of fish in the sea, but see, I ain't no fisherman
See, I'm a middleman, a businessman, and this means business, man
Diggin' in the sand, lookin for a reason, I'm not kiddin', man

How am I gonna let all of this get to me?
Been a few months since you texted me
Shit, I'll just tell myself I'm a celebrity
Ain't no way that this can get to me
And in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter
But right now, it's feeling like everything
The more I talk about it, it just gets sadder
'Member thinkin' about a wedding ring
But now I'm thinkin' 'bout so many things
What did I do to deserve it?
This shit the most petty of petty things
I'll stick with how nobody's perfect
Like all of my life, I'll forget about it
And all of the things that I said about it
But why the fuck did I get blocked?
I just cannot wrap my head around it

I just can't wrap my head around it
Now I'm just getting bored, I'm just fuckin' up all the flows
Just for the fun of it
If you're still watchin' this shit, uh, comment, uh...
Comment ""Arrowhead water"" in the comments
And let me know what-what would you rate this out of ten
Give me a rating, that way know that you're real-
That you're real one, you know what I'm sayin'? Alright, here we go

Spectacular speculations
-Havin' some reservations
Imaginin' all the statements
-Travellin' through these places
Back in, then buy some passionate
Trashin' of reputations
They actually don't have facts, and
Reality left them baseless
I wish that we left 'em nameless
-'Sociate 'em with faces
Make judgments from expectations
And watch as their heads are shaking
-People want me to crumble
And turn to some medication
To fuck up my motivation
And focus on education

But I'm petty, petty, petty, petty
That's all they really ever tell me
So many times that you convince me of shit
That I swear you could've won an Emmy
I got a phone in my hand, like a note for the 'Gram
And I'm thinkin' about holdin' your hand, but you don't understand
I think t' 'ove is eith-either gold or a scam
And you never really know till the end, like, how all this began

I've been comin' at this as a man
Trying to figure out where I fit into the plan
How does all the drama surround me? I hear 'em followin' loudly
And I don't wanna hear about this shit again
I guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me
And do anything to try and stop me
I did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes
When a basic bitch try to block me, uh

Livin' life, but you're stayin' the same
How you expect yourself to go take the fame
Make your name, but you don't take the pain
You wanna be unique but not make a change
Like, what? How you expect to go through this
Think about the goals, man, why you wanna do this
So stupid and useless if you never lose it
Risk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-
This ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success
Don't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed
And I'm open to ""No"" and I'm open to ""Yes""
I'll do whatever I can to go to the best
That will go to the right and go to the left
No doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed
When I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest
I keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head
I think ""No, why do I even try these things?
I need shiny things like diamond rings
And flying rings and pricey bling- uh
That is what drives these strings
I'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time
Sayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme
Never go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime
Learnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my
Day, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'
To spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain
No, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'
Sittin' with a dream, and maybe
Maybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me
But I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!
Why am I just the B of the A-team
At the feet of the mainstream? Man, I dream for this daydream!
Uh, and I believe that I'm makin'
Cease for the takin', it's me in the train, and
I see that I'm breakin', my knees aren't place and
I keep on thinkin' that I'm being amazin'
But I'm improvin', I know it's just a slow climb
Pushin' myself, yeah, I'll be there in no time
So I'm movin', I'm movin' till I get there
Get where? I just don't want to get left there

I don't remember
I don't even know what that's from but that was written in there
It's been a lot of late nights, okay?

I don't give a fuck about anything
Skinny white child on the track, but I'm threatening, they don't wanna let 'em in
They told me if I take it, I'll feel better, like it's medicine
But I ain't settling, they tryna rush me, like adrenaline

And labels don't reply so I can get a deal
I've been itchin' for this shit, someone give me a Benadryl
I get hella skill, man, they worried that I never will
Have success in bills, man, the grill- haha seven mill'
I don't give a fuck about this shit, I've been goin' overboard and now they jumpin' on the ship
Man, they hypocrites, pimpin' they butterflies while they in- okay, that one was work, uh
And want my Christmas as a Christmas gift
Middle child, know I'm anythin' but in the middle, bitch
Man, I don't give a shit, I'm well behaved, and so articulate
I'm the type to ask my fucking teacher for a syllabus
Uh, uh
Existential crisis, every day I think I don't exist
Chicken little, I'm a fryin' pan, I'm a dyin' man
Wake up every mornin', I'ma make a fuckin' diagram
And find a plan to be the highest man in this giant land
Rap so fuckin' hard, I think I'm injurin' my diaphragm
Iron Man, think I'm Iron Man
Kids be puttin' fire emojis on my entire 'Gram, I'm a fireman
Second grade teacher got me singin' in the choir, man
And look at where I am, I never thought I would acquire fans
Acquire bands, say a bunch of random shit and rhyme it, man
That's how much I do not give a fuck, let's go to Ireland
Hundred grand on those rubber bands to hold your fuckin' bands
Listening to the cash register like your fuckin' jam
-Don't understand, like a Republican with a gun in his hand
Sayin' that ""Trump is the man to come with the plan"", livin' in wonderland
That shit is a fucking scam
Making America show that it's dumb again, ha! Ha...

They told me I needed to do a switch up
My friends told me I needed to get my hits up
It ain't that simple, I'm not someone that white teenagers wanna be like
I can't say ""Issa"" in a meme and have it pick up
Big up, I'm a transnational British person
Dimension C-137's my biggest version
I've been disturbin', music it isn't listed as urban
Air quotes next to my name in red caps, written as burden
I'm a fuckin' burden to every fuckin' person on this Earth, man
I'm determined, I'm tryna get it workin'
Sortin' out pins and needles like an amateur surgeon, that makes no sense
All these listeners are so dense
This song is conversational, so why you still talkin' to me?
I email artists, they haven't responded to me
My camera just went out, so why you still talkin' to me? Uh
I'm trying to give you free money, not fond of your feat
I'm tryna to make a deal, not call the police
I have free publicity, they don't want to be seen
I guess they don't wanna be seen, fuck these monopoly scenes
Uh, yeah, they collab with rappers with fifty plays
I hit 'em up about it and wait sixty days
Now I'm bigger than these rappers I'm askin'
I hit 'em up again, and then I never get a response, damn
What the fuck is happenin'? Damn

I said f-
Fuck a lawsuit, fuck a lawsuit, ayy
What'd it cost me is what it cost you, ayy
G-Gotta stop you, y'all are not cute, uh
No need to argue, 'cause I do not lose, ayy, uh

Who's your momma? I need to know who taught you, I need to
'Call you believe, but I'm sure that nobody believes you
I'm makin'-I'm makin' music, as soon as I start makin' money, you tryin' to review
You gonna claim every verse on my album, are you gonna claim these too?
'Cause I am independent, you a little jealous, and you skeptical of how I'm really sellin'
You assumin' that I can't legit defend it, I'ma send you out here with a prison sentence
Copyright-abusin' pricks, tryin' to profit off my music shit
Little do you know that I am not afraid of you, and so I will refuse to quit, you stupid bitch
I'm bad for real, my shit got mass appeal, ayy
Every song that I drop is an anthem, you don't really have to kneel, damn
Freestyle, you don't have to steal, don't like it? Well, you have to deal, damn
If I say it that it's how I feel, it's real, I don't pass no drill, damn
Plug called like we had a deal, man, this shit ain't daffodils, damn
When it all comes d- at my door, get the fl- 'oy like a Happy Meal, ayy
If it does, then I have to kill, name a track like the- you pass a d'ill-
Haha, to 'hi-, killer, bum-uh-dum-num, damn, I have to chill
Yeah, this a new wave, y'all are too late
You say you gon' start tomorrow, well, tomorrow's today
I get-I get all these bags, stuff 'em in a suitcase
You a thief, you be stealin' flows like you Boonk Gang

I accidentally quit out all these lyrics
So I was just trying to piece it together like a puzzle
You know what I'm saying? Ayy
Let's gom random shit, ayy

I take no credit for anything that I do
That's how I live life with a positive attitude
That's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you
That's the reason that people mirror my attributes
What I contribute to the world is
Some crazy shit nobody else's world did
And I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love
But, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck
I've been waitin', 'cause this is
The best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh
And I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted
When all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted

This is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this
I think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-
This is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this
Let's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this

It's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'
You leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'
I'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'
That's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion
Man, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm
Droppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em
It really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me
Bass and a good groove is really a great recipe
Can't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment
Feelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over
And I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next
And then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text
Like, ""Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real
But, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel
Like a god— well, you get what I'm sayin'?""
And goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing

I said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride
We feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high
Yeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit
All the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it
It's bumpin'

Really, this is bumpin' to me
You ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave
But this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me
I said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream
No, never mind, probably not
But I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts
And I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot
But lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot
And no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this
'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid
The fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby
Something for me to be original, not a lyin' copy
Tryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
Verses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing
Blah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress
Some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense
But now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'
See me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'
Every day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do
Listen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute
I got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too
Who just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who
But all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm
And that is the reason that I am making a shipment
I said it's bumpin'

Nearin'- we're nearin' an hour
If you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you
Long time, okay

I said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her
Hopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna
Move with it, ride with it
It's my life, the only burden is the time limit
Fuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, ""Fuck it, I'm livin'""
People getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'
Just because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it
Just because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it
I messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy
Ayy, ayy, uh
Just because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh

And how am I meant to keep my workflow up?
If a girl shows up, all my world blows up
I'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest
Tryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal
All you bitches fake, all my numbers real
All my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal
Am I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?
It's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing
Now, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even
They call me odd, but I bring even
I bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and
The meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons
Yeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'
I'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people
Man, I don't know people who so equal
I don't know nobody who doesn't own evil
Man, that is just a truth and a lie
A truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky
Or a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind
New to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise
And uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit
Oh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this
You get discouraged for one minute
And the next one, you be callin' it quits
And I'll probably get rich If I focus enough
You close-minded, let's open it up
And all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'
But they do not know what is up
Uh, I just wish
That they'd go away
And I won't obey
No, I will never ever show the way
And I will try to mask it up
With other jokes on fucking jokes
Always playin' G'
But now I'm movin' onto other notes

My voice is fucking hurting
It's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training
So I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time
Without causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?
Man, I just live it up
I'm gonna go a little bit quieter now
Uh-huh
Yeah

All of these people keep on changin'
All of these times and different phases
All of these lights on all these stages
All of these sights is so amazing
Yeah, I've seen at least a million faces
A million times, a million places
But when it's all said and done
I look and I wonder why, uh

Everyone knows that it's so amazing
All the support is my motivation
Compared to the big people at the Capital
My name is spelt in lower cases
People loved me before I made it
People liked it before they watched it
I'm wantin' way too much more than I have
And I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it
Man on a mission, and I g- vision
Of talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen
Gotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow
I'll be the teacher when they need the feature
Got flow, and it's so damn crazy
People consider me so amazing
I'm holding control and then folding them verses
It hurts because I am on loaded bases
Advanced shit, I know the basics
Already know them, they're overrated
Meanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'
'Cause now I am open for game, and
I'm charged up
I ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior
So many people they know the players
Don't know the game and don't know the makers
Don't know the fakers, but who cares?
I'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater
I'm here to go move and just go on the layers
And bitch, I am going so later
I got time
My own lyrics, I got mine
And I'm on time for the wrong lines
And I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go

I've been all on my own
All on my own, people keep calling my phone
Wanting to know when I'll be the star of the show
But I'm all my own, yeah
And I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it
'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-
The ghost of me is haunting the throne
So I'll make it there all on my own

My intermission is mixing with intermissions
And following intuition conflicting with my decision
And it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval
And it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful
And it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you
Appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement
To a new type of thing that you can gain from
To push away the past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago-

Oh, holy shit!
I actually reached the end of the beat
But I still have, like
Ten-thousand more words
Hold on, I gotta pause this
Hold on, three, it's still one take

-Past and the places that you came from
Day one for me was like six months ago
Look at where we been, but imagine where one can go
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
It's not fun to know that we just livin' to die
We now know how much money you can give for a lie
Give for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?
What's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?
So, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen
Always been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man

Yeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch
Uh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch

I know like four people who truly respect the grind
And it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
And then if time is money then free time ain't really free
And all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me
-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree
I want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me
In the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me
Bigger than you, bigger than anybody in history
The challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize
To satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time
And luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time
To learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
I'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got
Several different things to potentially make my job
I want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs
And also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks
A million- shit, all we ever want is more, really
And once I get three million, I want four milli'
It's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle
We can never be happy, but that is so vital

Uh
Those are actually some good lyrics, uh

Rebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt
They're weaker than previously, her
Breathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were
Before we could be searched, I'm like ""Please, just please work""
Like a lenient slave owner— that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me
I saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy
I play- I play-
-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?
Uh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do
Disgusted like, ""Ew"", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true
I'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do
It's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue
Fillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed
It gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh
But if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?
And why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?
That shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up
But nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up
L—

—cay to the Vatican, havin' them
Good times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when
I was so young, too young to really know fun
But so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up
Dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
Just keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge
But we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate
Such a twisted system that we've been given to operate
I've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake
Wash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed
Yeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away
And it's so far away

This a civil war
It's a fuckin' civil war
Yeah, we be aimin' to the peace
So what we killin' for?
Yeah, anymore
What we even livin' for?
Yeah, they be murderin' for peace
That is a civil war

You know- you know they be lookin' at me right now
Like the sewer system, they about to pipe down
I've been writin' my essays, my webpage
Yeah, I call that a new construction site now
Blue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out
All these questions, man, I really wanna hide out
Or I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout
My shit before I wait to see it die out
Damn, I-I just wanna go along
I'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one
I'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up
They know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the
Doin' in the big leagues like I got drafted
Before the year-round hype over March Madness
Wanna get it to where these girls strippin' down
Like it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes
They be sayin', ""Damn, Ben really got savage""
No, but unlike you, I am not average-

Hold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental
This is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick
I'm gonna fix it, take a pause
Uh, yeah, ayy

I'm addicted to the screen and the validations
Of people who are thirteen in another nation
I've been looking for acceptance in the message
Or a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted
Like Internet track meets, they erased it
Look at this shit, I've just recently made it
That how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'
Acheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it
Y'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro
You doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so
Allow me to break free from my own dome
To get out and be me, believe in my own zone
Things become intense in the heat of the ozone
It's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so
Can I pretty please just be al-alone?
Nobody to retweet, delete on my home phone
I ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit
When they all claimin' they love it, uh
I ain't gon' hop on that loud shit
When I know I ain't about it, uh
Yeah, they cannot take this away now
They have something to say now
You cannot order this shit on a takeout
All of these bitches is fake now

—My clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually
And I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties
-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary
Man, I said, ""Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy""
Trappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family
Now I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me
Now I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely
I got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay
Everybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy
Pull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy
Everyone's a critic on my case all the time
Do it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed

Bitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy
Get my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy
Until I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no
And they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy

Okay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit
I don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident
Wait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick
'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, ""What the fuck's happenin'?
Yeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep
Because a lot of people want a lot from me
Yeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be
Now random strangers recognize me when I cross the street

So many memories, do you remember these
Moments way back in the time?
Trapped in the back of my mind
I am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find
So much experience now that I'm passing the lines
Now that I'm grasping the signs
I have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide
No, I've got nothing to hide
Bitch, I am stuck, left behind
I need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride
Fill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now
Puttin' it off to the side
Feeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air
And I'm feeling so careless, but I can't
Let go
Damn
Every morning
I'm wanting to drop out
But I can't stop now
I put too much work in this shit to go pop out
So I walk down five different paths every day
Just need the one, it's only begun
No, I'm not going away
No, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say
That this shit is going badly at all
I'm glad that I fall
I love the ref, but I am mad at the call
I'm mad at the call
Yeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far
And I'm practicing hard
Never goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start

Uh, yeah
Putting my mind on the table
No, I am so able, I'm lining the cables
I got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label
I do the mixing and mastering
Writing and rapping and making it happen, I'm
Eating my cake, and I'm having it
Real emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate
And I am working my hardest
It's already started, yes, I am being an artist
I'm feeling the largest
I'm feeling the largest


Oh!
Is that the final beat change up?
Alright, we were on that last beat for like an hour
For lit- literally an hour... um..
But you know what? Gotta hop on this classic beat, ayy
Uh
Yeah
Had to change it for all you that have been watching till
Till the end, you know?
You didn't think that beat was ever gonna change, but it did, though
Uh, yeah
Ayy

Recently, I've been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
I'm trying to whitewash how much they stink like I'm Listerine-ing
Damn, I'm feeling like I've missed the key, and
So I guess that DJ Khaled is always skipping me
But, yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
Yeah, you know I'm tryn  do what I can
But these ignorant idiots just can't understand
I got new crews and the new friends, got new views in a new lens
I'm the new dude, I'm the new Ben, got my YouTube with the new trends
But the way I'm growing is so unorthodox
How could I be connecting them if I have yet to sort the dots?
Sorta lost and very found at the same time
I pour the cost, now I'm very loud in a daytime
And very quiet at night- seem to shine when I write
And I'm longin' to be a five-year-old, chillin', flyin' a kite
And I admire the sight of somebody else workin' more than me
I've been staying grounded, but the sky is movin' towards my feet
And fortunately, I'm on course, living morally
Grinding to get what's rightfully mine, I'm headed right for my dream
Damn, I guess that's all I need to know for now
They put me in the driver's seat, no way I'm slowing down
They know me now but don't know my sound, it is so profound
Give m- two years and I'll make it, let me show you how
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

I gotta stop all of this bragging shit
So many haters, S.M.H. is the acronym
I'm tryna get a couple ""OMG""'s
Or a, ""WTF, he is so sexy""
I got no Bentley, beat is so deadly
Walked up to the rap club, no entry
And I feel a little like I won't get seen
'Cause I'm so white, won't fight, don't get me
'Cause I'm coming at this music with a different set of ideas
Trying to bring my own crib like it's Ikea
Here's a pro-tip: take no tips
From people who aren't pros yet, bitches always so stressed
Damn, 'cause they trying to find that great escape
Nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
Every day, I be waking up to my 808s
Day-to-day hustle, I'm just trying to pave a way
People with the problems always give the most advice
Like, why don't you sort your own life? Don't come close to mine
I'm mostly fine, so please leave me alone to whine
And next time that you're talking shit, please bring me an open mind
'Cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
I'm David Blaine's magic- helping you break past it
I'm trying to raise havoc, not trying to stay savage
Trying to make balance while finding a great passion
Climbing to get up this- witnessin' injustice
By who people in love with or based off of skin colors-
Shit is so disgusting- seeing it in public
I'm trying to make sense of it here in the discussions-
Close my eyes and go to sleep, waiting until they notice me
Wait until my creations are making everything so complete
My thoughts are scattered- find lots of patterns
I try not to let it get my plots in ashes

I don't ever think I've- some money, some- little talent
These rappers' shows look like lip-sync battles with Jimmy Fallon
What really happened? I'm jealous if people selling platinum
Worst year of my life? That's like saying the worst Kendrick album;
It's way better than average, I'm already established
Unforgettable classic, y'all shit is set to go plastic
They want to see me disappear like incredible magic
Your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
I'm getting listens and play, fuck all the simpler days
I just took a moo- mon- break- I got Spotify paying me minimum wage
I'm like that's good enough, man, I've been eating, ain't full enough, I just want to make it pulling up
I've been putting up with all of these amateurs, sure enough, I'ma show 'em how it should be done

I got green and I want beef like a omnivore
I got that exclusive flow that can't be bought at stores-
All this new shit, they still be wanting more
They say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
I'm stacking rolls, just like the Michelin Man
Eating sushi every night, but I don't live in Japan
Damn, I'm trying to get as many hits as I can
And like a lazy-ass beaver, I ain't giving a damn
Woah, this shit is corny, you really gonna ignore me?
You really gon' let it slide when these Benjamins do adore me?
And as we rise, man, it ain't about fame and fortune
We got a greater importance, that's why I wake in the morning
I'm tryna play a performance- make a change with a chorus
I came from a tiny platform, but now my stage is enormous
Flawless, do anything to stay out of office
'Cause I'm cautious, not gonna sell my soul for the profits

Yeah, I got many dreams, lot of passions
I'ma get there by any means, just imagine
Just know that anything can happen
Take chances, put everything in rapping
I don't even really need to go fast
Flow back, not wandering like a nomad
So glad, yeah, they all melt like a snowman
Back-to-back flames got Drake sayin', ""Oh, man""
Not again, got a lotta friends who wanna end
All my shit, unsubscribe like I'm On Demand
I've been living in a moment, got a lot of fans
Pedophile back at it again with the white vans
Can't lie, man, I got a lot of white fans
Could I get a ultralight beam, maybe by chance?
Every day I've been switching up on my stance
Scare everyone away whenever I dance
People in the comments saying that I can't rap
Okay, 'cause I didn't understand that
Fuck you, man, I think it's time to stand back
You'll be sittin', gettin' in the way like a sandbag
If you want to talk trash, say it to my face
I'll be singin', ""La-la"", I got two LA's-
I be laughin', ""Haha"" at the human race
Hey, I'm in the lead, not far from a newer place
Uh- gettin' sick and sicker
The flow on the track gettin' quicker and quicker
Shiver me timbers, I'm winnin' these bigger
Killer victor, not swipin' left like it's Tinder
They filter my picture, put it in bad light-
Uh, me playin' these rappers is a bad fight
Ayy, me spittin' these bars, that's a mad sight
Haters be changin' their opinions, is that right?
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm winnin'- I'm winnin'- I'm spittin' a million words per the minute
I'm in it to win it, I'm in it to win it, I'm fixin' to hit it, uh
This shit is my mission, not up to your opinions
You know that I'm grinnin', ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

But I don't wanna be a ribbon in the sky
Livin' in disguise, man, I see the venom in the middle of their eyes
Figure if you're livin' or you die
'Cause it's time for you to finish your reply
I've been dealin' with these guys, know that I ain't black and I rap
So I guess I'm automatically wack, when, matter of fact
I am better than like half of these actors
Outdated, like a battery pack that a Blackberry has
On the back of its tab
-Rapping has the wrath of attack to send a missile back to Iraq
Then leave a crack on the map
And put my train of thought right back on the track, oh
All these rappers out of breath
-That gasp like a motherfuckin' asthma attack, yeah
Match, match, match, makin' flames when I swipe right
And I ain't talkin' 'bout some crap on an app
-Blowin' up with bars like a TNT
Blowin' up: TNT, with bars: AT&T
I'm the one you may see on a screen
I won't be passin' out like, ""Hey! Is he on lean?""
Nah, I ain't about that
The music that I make is a motherfuckin' soundtrack
To the dopest life, Big Sean better bounce back
Everybody tryna raise the stakes? Well, they better take it out back
I got a lot on my mind, I cannot go behind
Uh, ayy, ayy, ayy
I just deleted the- all those lyrics
But that don't matter, 'cause I'm sayin' them in spirit, bitch, uh!

Who would'a, who would'a thought
That Quadeca woulda moved to the top? I've been doin' a lot, ayy
See me for the music I make
Not the views, not the shoes that I bought
I mean who would'a thought that I'd go up, up and away?
5K to 100K in a month how I play
'Fucker think he runnin' the game
See these haters, now they runnin' away 'cause I've come here to stay
Comin' from the jump in L.A.​
But a boy been comin' up in the Bay, where they utter my name
Man, I'm like, ""What-what do I say
To a friend who think we one in the same?"" 'Cause I'm done with the games
Sayin' ""This is fuckin' insane""
Wanted bars, well, no one can complain, yeah, they lovin' the claims
I got an abundance of pain
When I drop it, it just bust into flames, it just bust into-
Yeah

Who would'a, who would'a thought
That a motherfucker'd hop on UK vibe like I'm Drake?
Ayy, who would'a thought
I'd be spittin' all these syllables without makin' a single mistake?

But, I've actually- I've actually made a lot of mistakes, ooh, ooh
I've made a- made a lot of mistakes, ooh
I'm so big, I make hippopotamus shake, ooh
That's-that's really bad, ayy

Uh
Got to drink some water, it's great
Got a lot on my plate... uh
Damn

This is the third time we're on this beat
I do this beat like twenty times
But that's okay, 'cause you know I got so many rhymes
You know what? On this one, I'ma just freestyle, uh
Uh, I got all your bitches on my speed dial
Ayy, and you sittin' there, meanwhile
I'm doing all this shit, I got it like it's a free trial
Free trial, I ain't spending no money
Now everybody lookin' at me, say I'm so funny
But not in a way where they're laughin' with me
Now they're laughin' at me, man, they so silly
They so- they like BILLY by Tekashi
Now everybody, you know that they wanna stop me
But they not gon' stop me 'cause I'm not gon' let them
And now, everybody, you know that I want to get up
Into the best place, into the best place
Now everybody, I be writin' all my essays
I write my music like a motherfuckin' essay
'Cause who else is doin' hu- a hundred-sixty pages on a damn song?
Uh, 'cause I'm makin' this so damn long
People lookin' at me, need a blood- motherfuckin' tampon
Yeah, 'cause he's so borin' now
Everybody, man, you know I'm makin' goals, I'm scorin' now
I'm pourin' now, all your shit is trash, I'm pourin' out
Pourin' it in-into the garbage 'cause you know I'm snorin' now
You guys are tirin', see, you are so tirin'
I'm doing all this shit, I'm killin' shit, man, I am violent
Ayy, I got the strings like a violin
People lookin' at me, they like how the fuck I'm rhymin' this
I don't even know, this is off the top now
Got a lot of bitches, but I'm never gonna stop now
This is it what I gotta do, I'ma do it now!
Fuck all of these bitches, I make music now
Uh, they be like, ""Who's makin' that stupid sound?""
I'm like ""That's me, bitch! That's me, bitch""
I got all these people, see me on a f- tree, bitch
This a treat, bitch, this ain't remixed
I got people lookin' at me now, they wanna be me, they wanna be this
But they can't, they gon' get this
Lookin' at you, I'ma shoot my shots, you better get hit
Ayy, 'cause you know I'm 'bout to get lit
Everybody, you know that I'm doin' this the best-est
The best-est in the nation
Everybody,  take me to the station
Best in the nation, might go on a vacation
Look at all these people: ""Uh-uh-uh-uh...""; hesitation
And I'm elevatin', got a reservate in
Ayy, all you motherfuckers waitin', but I am demonstratin'
Demonstratin' what I gotta do now
Ooh, you know that I'm movin' right through now
People lookin' at me, I'm like ""Who? How?""
I don't know, I'm just askin' a bunch of questions now
Uh, but I'm never gonna let it down

Great plate, great escape, I lost my style
I lost my style.. okay
That was a- actually a pretty good freestyle, damn
Uh, uh, uh

-Money on the run, that's running business
-Do this shit for fun? That's some decision
Coming in this, I wondered, ""Is this a road that they'll be fucking with?""
They loving it, making paper, like Dunder Mifflin
Still got haters and doubters I keep on running into
-Got a problem? Hop on the track, I'd love to diss you
People hate on successes, you got some fucking issues
Like- damn, need me to get you another tissue?
Just please don't go- come back, no one'll miss you
Well, I won't, I'll shrug my shoulders and just continue
On my mission, encountered a lot of villains
I'm kicking them down repeatedly lyrically, like it's some Jujitsu

Uh, damn
You know that I am the fucking man
Uh, I'ma make this money, make a hundred grand
I don't really think that you'll understand
Understand, 'cause I'm back again
A fan again, I'm going to war, like Afghanistan
What's the plan?
The plan- the plan, man, to plan man?
I'ma do the shit, I'ma do the same thing
I'ma do this shit goin' on my campaign
Celebratin' every day, I'm drinkin' champagne
Ooh, and you're gonna know my damn name
Gonna know my last name, now they see me in the rap game
Uh, they look at me like, ""How that changed""
But- t-truly nothing even changed, though
Uh, all these rappers got the same flow
So it's good to evolve, like Play-Doh
'Cause I get molded, I get molded every day, bro
Every day, bro, but I ain't Jake Paul
Sliding into home base with your bitch; baseball
Hey! And now, you're gonna go fall
Uh, but you know I'm gonna go far
I might go in Mario Kart in a go-kart
I got people, now you know I'm goin' so far
So far, but I'm never gonna backtrack
I got all these people send me pics on the Snapchat
But I don't even use Snapchat
People lookin' at me, I might move that back
To the past rap, I be doin' mad facts
All my math facts in my math class, I got backpacks
On my back-back, bag-bag it up
I got all this money, now I stack-stack it up
Oh, ayy, freestylin's pretty fun, though
To be honest, you be lookin' like a dumbo
Oh, oh, who's the winner, bitch?

They focusing, they noticing, they know it's him
Got doors I be opening
Uh- game like some Yeezy's, I've just broken in
They all convinced that I ain't supposed to win
Now my flow's like water, 'cause it's soaking in
They won't go swim, more salty than a ocean is
I'm floatin' in-

Seen as automatically wack, uh
Like an asthma attack, havin' ass in the back of your class
But you know that I don't give a motherfuckin' half of a crap
Matter of fact
I ain't never gon' be packin' my bags, and that's a wrap

People lookin' at me, now they likin' how I rap, uh
Rap, rap, rap, rap, rap song
People looking at me, know my rap is that long

Cuttin' out my paper like a coupon
Uh, might rate it like Groupon
Get your group on, jget your raps on
People looking at me, now I make a rap song
Uh, uh, when I'm with your girl, I last long
That's a fact, bitch, better put it up and fact
That's a fact, better put it up in stone writin'
People lookin' at me, they be like ""I don't like it""
Well, that's too bad, I might have to go bike you
Off to the ship because, to be honest, man, I don't like you
Don't like you and that is the true shit
Uh, now you lookin' like a U, bitch
Rubik's Cube, but I ain't Logic

So you can eat it
And then enjoy it, 'cause it's a Kit Kat and Kit Kats

Alright, this is the most mentally-exhausting
Mentally-draining thing I've ever done

I Saw the Sign,Boomboys,"6 ContributorsThe Trapper’s Pelts LyricsWhat a day to be alive!
The state of everything
I know you saw the sign (in the window)
The braying fist on hollow wood
Sticky fingers on sugar glass
Are you really so? (desperate desperate desperate)
All that divides us is evil/ All that unites us is evil
No, all that really divides is the binary hive mind
And the restraint that it takes, not to stick ourselves
Into every abstract object on the gallery shelves
Then the trapper came around
He was trying to sell me pelts
It was midday on a Monday
So all the smart people were at work
Trap music blaring from his furry boombox
The trapper tripped, I laughed he flipped, said
SHUT YOUR FUCKING TRAP
Or I’ll eradicate nature, right now forever
Or I’ll eradicate nature, right now forever
So I bought all his pelts (all his pelts!)
At a bulk buy discount
I took out a small business loan
And I bought all his pelts
I threw them in the boot of my car and drove downtown
I pitched up a stall, outside the office blocks
And come five o’clock, it was so cold
That everybody needed one, everybody wanted two
So I upped the price and I bled them dry cuz that’s what you do
And come six o’clock, I’d oversold
And my smile was made of solid gold
See Yard Act LiveGet tickets as low as $17You might also likeI collapsed under the weight of my own success (Yes)
And driving away with my many grapes, my many women
And my ginormous mountain of never ending blow
I saw the trapper disappear from my rear view mirror
With no pelts to call his own
Shivering, naked and all alone… In the snow
The senseless charm, the gnawing guilt (THE TRAPPER’S PELTS, THE TRAPPER’S PELTS!)
The senseless charm, the gnawing guilt (THE TRAPPER’S PELTS, THE TRAPPER’S PELTS!)
The senseless charm, the gnawing guilt (THE TRAPPER’S PELTS, THE TRAPPER’S PELTS!)
The senseless charm, the gnawing guilt (THE TRAPPER’S PELTS, THE TRAPPER’S PELTS!)

Fire Flies,Fireflies,"89 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFire Flies Lyrics
If you see me floating too many times
My face will be painted in these white brick lines

'Cause all my fears invaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time

'Cause all my fear's evaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

If all you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fallen man
Every call and cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I got drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I got drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?

King (made popular by Years & Years) [backing version],Party Tyme,"71 Contributors20 Best Albums of 2015 LyricsAs 2015 comes to a close, it's hard to remember all the great music we heard this year. Why? There was so much of it. 2014 was bookended by astounding years, with 2015 possibly overtaking the number of classic releases 2013 gave us. The enigma from Atlanta, Future, dropped four projects; dreamy duo Beach House released two albums in as many months. Break-outs like Jamie xx caught our attention and hip-hop superstar Kendrick Lamar demanded it. Here are the 20 best albums of 2015. — Michael Heal
         20. A$AP Rocky - At.Long.Last.A$AP2015 began with the passing of Rocky’s close-friend and collaborator A$AP Yams, the mastermind behind the A$AP organization, but Pretty Flacko bounced back in May with his long-awaited sophomore album, At.Long.Last.A$AP. Rocky used the tragedy as motivation to deliver one of the best rap albums of the year, dedicated to the late Yamborghini
At.Long.Last.A$AP was proclaimed ""the return of the God MC,"" delivering insightful lyrics and fusing elements of psychedelic rock with the promethazine-inspired trap Rocky's become famous for. The majority of the album was recorded in London, where Rocky discovered a protégé and a friend in Joe Fox, who appears on stand-outs “Max B” and “Jukebox Joints,” (which says something on a track featuring Kanye West). However, the best cut belongs to Rocky and Bones, who linked up for a marauding ode to New York’s “Canal St.” The collage of high-quality music elevates Flacko to rap royalty and keeps the memory of A$AP Yams eternal. — Vuk Aleksić
         19. Florence + the Machine - How Big, How Blue, How BeautifulFlorence + the Machine continue to set baroque-pop standards with their album How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful. Its simple concept—lead singer Florence Welch attempts to break off a relationship—soars thanks to a heap of melodrama and a pinch of restraint.
Welch lets her emotions shine through her vocals, whether she's growling on the rage-filled ""What Kind of Man,"" or sighing resignedly on the atmospheric ""Long & Lost"". By limiting how many times she references water, Welch stretches her lyricism to encompass even more imagery. The transcendent results include ""Delilah,"" which elevates a missed phone call to Biblical proportions: “I'm calling for my mother as I pull the pillars down /It's a different kind of danger and my feet are spinning around / Never knew I was a dancer —'til Delilah showed me how.”
Producer Markus Dravs redirects F+TM's sound, preserving the band's lushness, while giving the guitarists more presence. Goldfrapp's Will Gregory arranges the new horn ensemble, which exhale sharply on the medieval ""Queen of Peace.""
The title track embodies HBHBHB. An acoustic guitar erupts into rueful nostalgia. Welch melts into the words ""every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips,"" and lets out an improv ""woo!"" The jaunt climaxes with a three-minute instrumental, with hearty trumpets that could score a death scene. F+TM might be indulgent as times, but their expansive sound captures love's sweeping emotions. As Welch puts it in ""Caught"":Old friends have said, the books I've read, say it's the thing to do / But it's hard to see it when you're in it, cause I went blind for you.— Chihuahua0
         18. Future - 56 Nights56 Nights celebrates Future's close friend and collaborator DJ Esco's release from a Dubai prison. Alternately somber and jubilant, the album paints a picture of a drugged out but resilient creative, drowning his pain in codeine to inspire the trappers he left behind.  Following on the heels of 2014's breakup record Monster and the innovative Zaytoven collab Beast Mode #FutureHive were in full swarm for fresh heat rocks—they were satiated by tracks like ""Trap Niggas"" and ""March Madness,"" which retain a social conscience in the midst of debauchery and felony. ""March Madness,"" one of 2015's liveliest bangers, comes with a triumphant beat from Tarentino (it's the only track on the tape not produced by Southside)—it's both an ode to lean and an elegy.
“All these cops killing niggas tragic” somehow doesn't sound out of place on what became a club and radio standard. The anthemic “Trap Niggas” is much more than a series of coke rap tropes on a dark brooding beat. Future's shifting between first and third person invites the listener to identify with him and universalizes the dealer's struggle. He offers a message of hope, rooted in a profound belief that whatever one's station in life and the thankless tasks one performs, ""God blessing all the trap niggas.”

         17. Clarence Clarity - No NowIf you’re thinking Clarence Clarity sounds like an internet meme, you’re not entirely wrong. No Now is the debut album by multi-instrumentalist, singer, and embodiment of the internet age. The maximalist atmosphere of No Now entertains even those with the shortest attention spans, as sounds from seemingly countless genres clash, glitch, and mold into one to create the most serene aura.
Clarence’s musical style likely derives from his drive to be different, something made abundantly clear on the second track, “Will to Believe,” as he breaks through a dense wall of sound to denounce the non-risk takers and those who attempt to appear “cute."" In the modern era where songs rarely stick to one pure genre, artists are boxed in by a myriad of sound-defining labels. Clarence Clarity has managed to create his own box.
No Now is hectic. It’s unpredictable. It’s ever-changing. From the poppy melodies of “Those Who Can’t Cheat” to the gritty guitar work of “Porn Mountain,” to the completely glitched-out mess of “Hit Factory of Sadness,” Clarence Clarity creates a unique journey. In a way, No Now represents the world we live in. Nothing is guaranteed in the future—all we have is now. We can choose to sit back and let the universe take its path, or we can evolve and become one with the erratic atmosphere. Take a step into Clarence Clarity’s beautifully insane world with No Now; you’ll find the unknown to be quite exhilarating. — Matt Witkowsky
         16. Wolf Alice – My Love Is Cool“Keep your beady eyes on me”, warns 23-year-old Ellie Roswell over shimmering synths and intricate guitar arpeggios, and it would be hard to resist. The album’s opener, “Turn to Dust,"" is a seductive, enigmatic number which sets the tone of the London four-piece’s debut: cool, accomplished, and never failing to surprise the listener. No two tracks sound the same; indeed, in the middle of the album, we’re transported on a whistle-stop tour from the smooth and considered “Silk” to the jazzy slap bass of “Freazy,"" and then to the energetic single “Giant Peach,"" which sounds like it could’ve been written in the mid-90s. Producer Mike Crossey’s versatility is commendable; his sound knowledge of dynamics is especially prominent on songs like “Fluffy,"" tracks are spacious and reflective when necessary, and the incredible diversity of styles makes it all the more impressive that one man has achieved such a feat.
All four members of the band lend their vocal talents to the project, with Joel taking full creative reign and lead vocals on the reverb-drenched “Swallowtail."" “I never thought we’d hit this hard,"" he sings in the verses, before breaking into an assured falsetto for the chorus. A cynic could call this sort of variation inconsistent, but the eclectic styles allow the band members’ individual skills to flourish. If you appreciate unique lyricism, innovative structure, and great replay value, don't sleep on My Love Is Cool.

         15. Miguel - WildheartMiguel begins his third LP with the words “Don’t ever sell your self short for acceptance.” It’s a drastic change from what we’ve come to expect on the opening of a Miguel album. It follows a heartfelt Instagram post in which he detailed the spark behind Wildheart. As well as the personal and emotional sentiment, he takes inspiration from his home town of L.A, with every song having a connection to the City of Angels. This concept allows Miguel to expand his horizons and showcase the improvement in his writing skills, with themes of power, fame, childhood insecurities and at his most daring, alluding to L.A’s adult film industry on “The Valley.”
The infusion of electric guitars layered over heavy bass lines and synths results in a psychedelic rock-r&b sound reminiscent of Prince’s Sign O’ The Times. The atmospheric vibe beautifully meshes over his more passionate songs, with “FLESH” and the deluxe edition cut “gfg” showcasing his breathtaking falsetto. Over a pulsating bass, backed by an electric guitar riff, the lead single “Coffee” seamlessly acts as a successor to “Adorn.” It follows his guilty pleasure of morning after sex, and the transformation of a purely sexual relationship into one of greater intimacy.
Although it faltered commercially, the album was highly praised by critics and fans alike. However, had everything gone according to plan, “waves” would have likely topped the charts and Miguel’s praises would be ringing even higher. But as contemporary R&B continues to stray towards a drug induced sound with repetitive themes of lust and narcotic abuse, one of the genre's finest continues to challenge his sound and breathe new life into the genre with what may be his finest work to date. — zk123
         14. Beach House - Thank Your Lucky StarsWhen discussing Thank Your Lucky Stars, one fact is inescapable: it’s not the album Beach House were trying to make.  And whilst the search for a context-free album may be a fool’s errand, if Stars were a debut album from an up and coming band, it would be celebrated as evidence of a great emerging talent.
It’s true that most of these songs probably wouldn’t have worked on Depression Cherry, but they’re still great songs – indeed, “Elegy To The Void,"" with its dark lyrics and chilling outro, may be their best since “Take Care."" Beach House aren’t a conventional band, but they have a very defined sound which these songs push against. There’s much more going on in the lower registers here than on any Beach House album since Devotion, at least. The lyrics, too, are much more grounded; while Legrand usually speaks directly to the listener about grand themes, Stars makes much more use of the third person. Mysterious women lead you to pools of water, lovers bend at the altar, schoolgirls pray by fading lace curtains – it’s all quite reminiscent of Ishmael Butler. This is as close to traditional storytelling as Beach House has ever come. We’re dropped into real lives and given snippets of information that are just enough to construct a portrait of who they really are.
There is an obvious temptation to dismiss this as an afterthought to a masterpiece, but it’s much more than that. It’s almost like the eccentric second disk of one of the great double albums of the seventies. It’s not Depression Cherry, but it more than stands alone. — Vesuvius
         13. Natalie Prass - Natalie PrassIn an era of surprise releases and casual DIY mixtapes, it’s hard to imagine a label taking two years to release a great record, but that’s exactly what Spacebomb Records did with Natalie Prass.
Trey Pollard’s string arrangements accentuate Prass’s delicate delivery, whilst the horns in the instrumental bridge of “Bird Of Prey” bare Matthew E. White’s fingerprints. Break-up records are a dime a dozen, but these breathtaking arrangements are all too rare in contemporary pop. Pollard and White deserve a great deal of credit for the album’s overwhelmingly positive reception.
But Prass’s songwriting is what lifts this record above White’s Big Inner. Her songs are much more accessible and charming than those of her label mate. Her use of metaphor is constantly delightful – break-up as predation, as a fantasy novel, as a train pulling away from a platform - and some of her imagery is visceral. She may knock her singing voice, but Prass provides plenty of intriguing inflections, and her vocals simultaneously convey her heartbreak and confidence. The crescendo of “My Baby Don’t Understand Me” is so affecting because of the synergy between arrangement, performance, and the train station goodbye metaphor
Nobody wants a needless two year delay before they can hear a record – but if it allows Prass and Spacebomb to keep making records like this, it’s completely worthwhile.
— Vesuvius
         12. Lupe Fiasco - Tetsuo & YouthLupe struck that elusive balance between beautiful instrumentals, intelligent lyrics and vivid storytelling with Tetsuo & Youth. Fans and critics alike have praised the album – it’s even been referred to as ""a Rap Genius wet dream.""
Yet T&Y is so much more than just complex, annotation-worthy lyricism (though there’s plenty of that too). Lupe organised the album into three distinct sections separated by “sonic palate cleansers” named after the four seasons. Songs are feel-good and upbeat from ""Summer"" to ""Fall,"" more melancholy leading into ""Winter,"" and then quite ominous (though by ""Spring"" things start to look up again).
While every track is brilliantly executed, of particular note are the three monsters, each exceeding 8 minutes in length. Summer's ""Mural"" is an all-bars-no-hook lyrical assault that will leave you physically tired (in a good way) by the end. Fall's ""Prisoner 1 & 2"" is the most musically complex track on the album, with lyrics drawing a parallel between prison inmates and guards and a striking foundation of string and piano arrangements. Winter’s ""Chopper"" is a ratchet, bass-heavy beast featuring 6 artists that most wouldn’t think team up with Lu.
Few contest that Lupe Fiasco is a lyrical and creative genius, and his ability arguably shines brighter on T&Y than on any of his previous albums. Its seasonal transitions mean you can start listening to any track, come around full circle and experience the album in a completely different way. And just when you think you've digested everything T&Y has to offer, take our word for it and listen once more -- backwards. — Treflip
         11. Courtney Barnett - Sometimes I Sit And Think, and Sometimes I Just SitCourtney Barnett’s debut album is quirky and awkward, much in the vein of getting the title of it: taking it from a poster that hung in her grandmother's bedroom. Abrasive guitar riffs simultaneously flow and jag behind Barnett, who sing-talks about, well, everything. Her breakout single “Avant Gardener” puns off of “avant garde."" You can guess where that goes. Topics include trying to impress someone while swimming and accidentally fainting, a rambling rant about anything to get someone off her mind, and a home-buyer's depressing first time looking into the market. However, it also explores concepts like her newfound fame and self-worth.
What really makes the album great is its lack of inhibition.  Sometimes I Sit And Think, And Sometimes I Just Sit is poignant, but not forced. Her lyrics paint of picture of seemingly anything. It's an album you can sit and think to--or at least just sit. Even if she doesn't know who she is, she surely sounds good trying to find out. — Babu Sea
         10. Tame Impala - CurrentsCurrents is a stunning, near-perfect sonic achievement, made all the more powerful by the clash between its precise instrumentals and hazy lyrics. The LP announces Tame Impala as the rare group whose work isn’t linked by rehashes of the same familiar sounds, but consistent mood, themes, and ethos present at the core of everything they record. The band’s third offering has been hailed as a departure from their previous work. More accurately, it’s an amplification of every shift Kevin Parker and co. made between their debut Innerspeaker and follow-up release Lonerism. After the magnetism of pop music shook up the group’s lo-fi sound, Currents pushes the needle even further from psychedelia and towards an R&B/disco sound that only threatened to claw to the surface on Lonerism. Instead of hesitantly stripping back a few more guitars, Parker all but phased them out for the synths that form the backbone of this LP. Rather than resist his his growing auteur-like tendencies, the group’s frontman/writer/producer Parker cut out all collaborations and added another responsibility to his ever-growing list: mixing.
Yet the remarkable thing about Currents isn’t how indistinguishable the record is from the band’s previous releases; it’s how perfectly it blends into the rest of their discography. Despite marked sonic and lyrical changes, it only takes a few notes from the massive intro track “Let It Happen” to realize this could only be a Tame Impala album. Whether this trilogy’s narrator slides into the past or embraces the healing properties of the future, puts on a false bravado or gets crippled by anxiety, we are never left feeling that the inconsistencies are the result of Parker conjuring up new narrators to deliver one-off tracks. Rather, we’re reminded a person is more than their current mindstate, just as a band isn’t defined by the amount of fuzzy guitars it’s employing in any given moment.
— Nick Ferguson
         9. Joanna Newsom - DiversCall this her My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy moment, minus the controversy. One of music’s greatest auteurs collects the stunning aesthetic signifiers of her previous classic works and imagines what they’d sound like all meshed together. Lacking the featured players from whom Kanye derived greatness, the lyricism instead is the most important guest star. Era-hopping, the loose concept album threaded by time visits a restless pastoral resident (“Leaving the City”), pre-Revolutionary America (“Sapokanikan”), and a futuristic militia on the outskirts of the Fourth World War (“Waltz of the 101st Airborne”), to name but a few. Maneuvering unconventional rhyme schemes is nothing new to her, and doctoral-level literary devices are played with the precision usually reserved for her harp. But like MBDTF before it, Divers is an extraordinarily listenable album, a populist masterpiece offered up by the only genius capable of creating it. — Brian Duricy
         8. Susanne Sundfør - Ten Love SongsWhen Susanne Sundfør released her third album, The Brothel, Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet said it would reduce her domestic rivals to tears. It was beautiful, but it would also make the chasm in talent that stood between them absolutely clear. No upcoming artist, and precious few established ones, could hope to compete with her.
The Brothel set a high bar, but Ten Love Songs is a clear step up again. Sundfør set out to write an album of songs centred on violence, but found each of them morphing into a song about love. The result is a startling album full of conflict, between narratives as well as characters. Our narrators are unreliable, often unsympathetic, and highly flawed, which makes them all the more compelling. On “Delirious,"" Sundfør threatens to push her victim “over the edge” because she believes him to be “the one holding the gun"". Meanwhile, “Silencer” is set in the aftermath of a jealous murder; Sundfør compares the swimming pool in which she disposes of the corpse as “an aquarelle of coral blue and red, like the colours of your lover's pretty eyes and hair.""
Sundfør’s vocal performances bring life to her lyrics. Her range is staggering, spanning octaves and emotions almost casually, even within songs. She convinces with everything from a breathy whisper to the unhinged power of Freddie Mercury in Queen’s early prog-metal stage.
Although the album has an electronic backbone, the instrumentation is varied, with classical instruments blending incredibly seamlessly with ultra-modern dubstep. The transitions between songs are similarly masterful, pulling the listener deeper into the album.
The Brothel  showed that Sundfør was leagues above other Norwegian artists. Ten Love Songs goes one better and establishes her in the upper echelon of pop musicians internationally. As a singer, songwriter, and visionary, few can match her. — Vesuvius
         7. Father John Misty - I Love You, HoneybearFor two albums, the sarcastic, witty, Josh Tillman has marauded both on wax and off as the pseudo-clerical persona Father John Misty. 2013’s Fear Fun, and its oft-referenced hallucinogen birth, marked a new creative outlet for a 21st century cynic. No longer bound by the serious shackles of a name he never cared for, or the dull “J. Tillman” his previous eight albums debuted under, Our Father uses the new name as a mask that counter-intuitively allows an album truer than before. This mask questions the amount of oil it takes to make a record; trolls the music press with singular post-irony; parodies whiskey commercials and social media; and hip shakes with post-postured confidence that predates “Hotline Bling” during eccentric live performances.
Consumerism, irony, and technological dependence return in his latest release, I Love You, Honeybear,through the bourgeoisie-bashing “Bored In The USA,” and “True Affection,” touching on the isolation and dissonance of digital communication. But at ILYHB’s core sits Tillman’s immutable motif – a struggle with identity. Falling in love only heightened the existential battle, creating what seems like a fourth iteration of the man. Now married, Emma Tillman is his “Honeybear.” Not something he actually calls her off-record, the pet name is a respite from the love songs that the misanthropic narrator so unexpectedly finds himself creating. In the middle tracks, loathsome ways introduced in Fear Fun return, yet, despite himself, he finds beauty through brutal honesty.
He conceals nothing from Emma, nor the captive audience; “The Ideal Husband” rattles off ineptitude upon ineptitude, finishing with the accept-me-as-I-am “Let’s put a baby in the oven / Wouldn’t I make the ideal husband?” On “Holy Shit,” the magnitude of his wedding day sinks in, as he simultaneously commits to the marriage while pointing out its institutional absurdity. Bookending the strange loop, “I Went to the Store One Day” is the truest “love song” here, recalling the words and place that spawned the relationship, but not without the self-aware lyrical outline “Insert here a sentiment re: our golden years.” Raw and unfiltered, for better or for worse, right? — Brock Chenier
         6. Grimes - Art AngelsThe disconnect between artist and consumer is rarely more apparent than when clear works of excellence are disregarded by their creator. When Grimes revealed her apprehensions about early single “REALiTi”’s quality, critics and fans collectively reacted in disbelief. How could one of the year’s best songs be a mere throwaway? And then we heard Art Angels. An album with alienation as a core inspiration containing some of the most zeitgeisty pop of the decade. Grimes told NME of “California,"" “I wanted to make a song that is so uncool that no cool hipster people would like it,” and yet, what could capture post-808s culture better than “You only like me when you think I’m looking sad”? A lucky few have the artist’s mind that could relate to her litmus test of song quality, but for the rest of us, all we know is that it’s unbelievably good. — Brian Duricy
         5. D'Angelo - Black MessiahLet your days slip away come with me and ride - D’Angelo, ""Ain’t That Easy."" Black Messiah is a gem that was 14 years in the making. When someone as talented and popular as D’Angelo just leaves the music scene at the height of his run and has all the well documented troubles he’s had, there are certainly a few questions  going into his latest, mysterious release. Could he rekindle that same magic from Voodoo and Brown Sugar? How would D’Angelo fit into today’s musical landscape? What we  got is a triumphant return and an album that lined up perfectly with today’s times. The socially cognizant nature of the album weighs on the racial tension going on in the United States. The Michael Brown situation actually inspired D’Angelo to move up the release date of the album. From samples of Black Panther Party member Fred Hampton, Nation of Islam/New Black Panther Party member Khalid Abdul Muhammad, to the cover for the album that was shot at an Afropunk concert, this album is deeply entrenched in Black culture. “The Charade” in particular captured the thoughts of African-Americans nationwide superbly.
The soul and emotion in D’Angelo’s voice and personal lyrics resonated as deeply as ever. In this musical endeavor, D’Angelo once again showed his mastery as an artist. From his instrumental performance, which included eclectic, but consistently stellar guitar work, to production, tremendous vocal harmonies, and lyrics, D’Angelo knocks it out of the park in every aspect. The cast he assembled included the likes of Questlove, Q-Tip, and Kendra Foster. On this record, D’Angelo showed that he still has that magic of years past and may in fact be sharper than ever.  A magnificent return album and certainly worth the 14 year wait.

         4. Jamie xx - In ColourThe highs of Jamie xx’s solo debut In Colour are euphoric. The atmospheric introspection of “Loud Places” to the unapologetically bright summer jam  “I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)” is the best back-to-back punch of the year. “Gosh” is an intimidating introduction, announcing its arrival with harsh jungle MC callouts, before sneaking in a deceptively gorgeous drone. Throw in two more collaborations from his xx bandmates Romy and Oliver Sim, and you have a top-heavy album that, while impressive, may initially threaten to topple the record as a whole. But under a microscope, the less memorable songs flourish in their own right. Even “Just Saying,” the 84-second prelude to “Stranger In A Room,” finds strength as a celestial version of a track from Grouper’s Ruins, whose keys keep their individual power in their differentiation, forcing intimacy through the sustained focus of each note. This divisive populist electro may never shake its myriad detractors who cry foul about the glossy repackaging of the scene it’s largely indebted to, but it’s wrong to dismiss such meticulously crafted production because of its accessibility. The monolithic In Colour will remain a striking affirmation of Jamie’s solo chops, long after Jamie xx lays down his synths. — Brock Chenier

         3. Beach House - Depression Cherry“There’s a place I want to take you,” says Victoria Legrand on “Levitation”, the opening track from Depression Cherry. She and Alex Scally certainly achieve that here. Their fifth studio album isn’t as cacophonous as Bloom, and it doesn’t dazzle like the peaks of Teen Dream, but it’s their most immersive and dream-like album. One can’t help but feel that it should switch names with the much more downbeat Teen Dream.
It may be dreamlike, but it’s not floaty or airy. This is one of those dreams that seem more real than real life, where colors are bolder, every detail etches itself onto your memory, and you find yourself stumbling onto profound truths about mortality, maturity, love, and loss every few minutes. The intensity is a steady 8/10 throughout, largely thanks to Legrand’s woozing synths and Scally’s guitar flourishes. Scally most shines on the album’s opening tracks. On “Space Song,"" his abrasive guitar sounds like it is popping the bubbles blown by the staccato synth arpeggios. A shimmering riff drives the intro of “Sparks,"" before Legrand’s heavy organ fades in and overwhelms him. The guitar is back in the second half of the song, whining in the background during several musical transitions.
That’s where the magic of Beach House can be found. They largely eschew traditional song structures. Where most think in beats per minute, Scally and Legrand, like Joanna Newsom, work in songs per minute. Instruments loop hypnotically, dropping in and out unpredictably. There are faster transitions, but even these are smooth, and give the impression that the album arrived fully-formed and immaculate. So do Legrand’s lyrics, that say “you will grow old too quick, then you will get over it”, and speak of a universe that “goes riding off with you” too soon. Sure enough, even this blissful record must come to an end. — Vesuvius
         2. Sufjan Stevens - Carrie & LowellSufjan Stevens has never done the same thing twice. A single glance through his discography reveals as eclectic a collection as one could ever hope for—handbells and pure synth, classical woodwinds and autotuned lamentations. What unites his albums is exactly this—a willingness to play and experiment
But this is not those albums. Carrie and Lowell is the sound of Sufjan Stevens distilled and perfected. He’s selected the best parts of his most successful styles and fused them into a perfect synthesis—bleak, unabashedly personal, and almost, but not quite, on the edge of low-fi.
Those qualities alone are enough to make any album shine. But don’t be mislead—just because there’s not the same sense of musical playfulness here doesn’t mean Sufjan isn’t breaking any new ground. Rather than a new musical style, Carrie & Lowell’s true genius lies in its lyrics. Carrie & Lowell sees Sufjan on a poetic form unmatched by any of his previous projects. The minimalist wonder of “Sister” or “Futile Devices,"" the dramatic flourishes of “Palisades""—all of these and more are reflected in his new album, in every song. Whether it’s the unalloyed joy he sees in his niece (“My brother had a daughter/the beauty that she brings, illumination”), or his self-destructive behavior in the wake of his mother’s death (“Should I tear my eyes out now? Everything I see returns to you somehow”) Sufjan infuses each line with the same understated beauty and wonder. Ultimately, Carrie & Lowell is a much more consistently poetic effort than any of his previous projects, and a much more ambitious one. Carrie & Lowell brings to the table a maturity, sensitivity and depth that Sufjan has only ever shown us glimpses of before—all while maintaining the absolutely note-perfect production and orchestration that is Sufjan’s forte.The only reason why I continue at all
Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb
Signs and wonders: sea lion caves in the dark
Blind faith, God’s grace, nothing else left to impart— nightpool
         1. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A ButterflyKendrick Lamar’s near 80-minute epic is a rollercoaster of emotion backed by an eclectic assortment of live instrumentation. G-funk to jazz, Compton to Africa, Kendrick navigates his way in search of answers on To Pimp A Butterfly. A stark contrast to his previous works, the LP draws parallels to an Oscar-nominated feature-length film; Kendrick nominated for best actor and director. Deep cuts like ""How Much a Dollar Cost"" require the listener to immediately rewind. We're sure President Obama was among them — he named the song his favorite from 2015.
Enthralling interludes and dark, brooding tracks like “u” find Lamar grappling with depression and survivor's guilt following his rise to stardom. Buoyancy comes in waves on the likes of “King Kunta” and “You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said),"" as Kendrick spits game for whoever’s willing to listen — the people listened. “Alright” became an overnight cultural phenomenon in the wake of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, as protestors chanted “We gon’ be alright!” in moving scenes just months after the album's release. Even Pulitzer Prize winner Michael Chabon couldn't ignore TPAB, within hours of ""The Blacker The Berry"" hitting the web, he was annotating the song right here on Genius.
Lamar engaged fans past dope drum breaks and hard-hitting lyrics to deliver an ambitious project full of tenacity and conviction — two traits he shares with idols 2Pac and Nelson Mandela. As the former prophesied: “I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.” Enter: Kendrick Lamar. — Michael HealCheck out the Genius Community's 50 Best Songs of 2015 here.60Embed"
Malle the Blue,Anocries,"2 ContributorsAlliterative Morte Arthure, Part IV LyricsBut on a Saterday at noon,   a seven-night there-after,
The cunningest Cardinal   that to the court longed
Kneeles to the conquerour   and carpes these wordes,
Prayes him for the pees   and proffers full large
To have pitee of the Pope,   that put was at-under           at a disadvantage
Besought him of suraunce   for sake of the Lord           a truce

Of eiers full avenaunt,   eight score children,           pleasant
In togges of tars   full richly attired,           Chinese silk
And betook them the king   and his clere knightes.           gave them to
When they had treted their trewe,   with trumping thereafter           discussed; truce
They trine unto a tent   where tables were raised;           go

Under a sylure of silk,   saught at the bordes.           canopy; reconciled
All the senatours are set   sere by them one,           each by himself
Served solemnly   with selcouthe metes.
The king, mighty of mirth,   with his mild wordes,
Rehetes the Romanes   at his rich table,           Cheers
Comfortes the Cardinal,   so knightly himselven,
And this roy real,   as romaunce us telles,
Reverences the Romans   in his rich table.
The taught men and the cunning,   when them time thought,
Tas their leve at the king   and turned again;           Take
To the citee that night   they sought at the gainest,
And thus the hostage of Rome   with Arthur is leved.
Then this roy real   reherses these wordes:           tells
""Now we may revel and rest,   for Rome is our owen!

And for slewth of slomour   on a sleep falles.           sloth; slumber
But by one after midnight   all his mood changed;           1:00 A.M.
He mette in the morn-while   full marvelous dremes;           dreamed; morning; dreams
And when his dredful dreme   was driven to the ende,
The king dares for doute,   die as he sholde,           cowers in fear
Sendes after philosophers,   and his affray telles:           terror
""Senn I was formed, in faith,   so ferd was I never!
For-thy ransackes redily   and rede me my swevenes,           Search; interpret; dreams

Kaires to ech a cogge   to comfort his knightes;           Travels; ship
To Clegis and Cleremond   he cries on loud:

To Lot and to Lionel   full lovely he meles,
And to Sir Launcelot de Lake   lordlich wordes:
""Let us cover the kith,   the coste is our own,           reclaim
And gar them brothelich blenk,   all yon blood-houndes!           make; violently blanch

Hew down hertily   yon hethen tikes!           dogs

Then he coveres his cogge   and catches on anker,           returns to; ship; anchor
Caught his comlich helm   with the clere mailes;
Buskes banners on brode,   beten of gules,           Raises; adorned with red
With crowns of clere gold   clenlich arrayed;
But there was chosen in the chef   a chalk-white maiden,           But there was placed in the chief a chalk-white maiden
And a child in her arm   that Chef is of heven;
Withouten changing in chase   these were the chef armes           noble
Of Arthur the avenaunt,   whiles he in erthe lenged.           worthy
Then the mariners meles   and masters of shippes;           get to work
Merrily ich a mate   menes til other;           each; speaks
Of their termes they talk,   how they were tidd,           They talk in their jargon about what has happened

Bete bonnetes on brode,   bettred hatches;           Set small sails; battened
Braundisht brown steel,   bragged in trumpes;           blew in trumpets
Standes stiff on the stamin,   steeres on after,           stalwartly on the prow

By then cogge upon cogge,   crayers and other,           ship; small ships
Castes crepers on-cross,   als to the craft longes;           grappling hooks across
Then was hed-ropes hewen,   that held up the mastes;
There was contek full keen   and cracking of shippes!           strife
Grete cogges of kemp   crashes in sonder!           war
Many cabane cleved,   cables destroyed,           cabins
Knightes and keen men   killed the bernes!

Castels full comlich   that coloured were fair!

Many freke in the fore-ship   fey is beleved!
Then brothly they beker   with bustous tackle;           fight; powerful equipment
Brushes boldly on borde   brenyed knightes,           Armoured knights rush boldly on board
Out of botes on borde,   was busked with stones,           (Coming) out of small boats on board, (and) were pelted with stones

Soon ochen in holly   the hethen knightes,           completely cut down
Hurt through the hard steel,   hele they never!           heal
Then they fall to the fight,   foines with speres,           duel
All the frekkest on front   that to the fight longes,           front rank
And ilkon freshly   fraistes their strenghes,           each one
War to fight in the fleet   with their fell wepenes.           to fight the battle
Thus they delt that day,   thir dubbed knightes,
Til all the Danes were dede   and in the deep throwen!
Then Bretons brothly   with brandes they hewen;
Lepes in upon loft   lordlich bernes;           through the air
When ledes of out-landes   lepen in waters,
All our lordes on loud   laughen at ones!
By then speres were sprongen,   spalded shippes,           broken; split
Spanioles speedily   sprented over-bordes;           Spaniards; leapt overboard
All the keen men of kemp,   knightes and other,           battle
Killed are cold-dede   and casten over-bordes;
Their swyers swiftly   has the swet leved;           young men; life-blood
Hethen hevand on hatch   in thir hawe rises,           heaving; these grey waves
Sinkand in the salt se   seven hundreth at ones!
Then Sir Gawain the good, he has the gree wonnen,           prize
And all the cogges grete   he gave to his knightes.
Sir Garin, Sir Griswold,   and other grete lordes;
Gart Galuth, a good gome,   gird off their hedes!           i.e., the captives'
Thus of the false fleet   upon the flood   happened,
And thus these ferin folk   fey are beleved!           foreign
Yet is the traitour on land   with tried knightes,
And all trumped they trip   on trapped steedes           accompanied with trumpets
Shews them under sheld   on the shire bankes;
He ne shuntes for no shame   but shewes full high!           shows himself
Sir Arthur and Gawain   avyed them bothen           set out
To sixty thousand of men   that in their sight hoved.
By this the folk was felled,   then was the flood passed;           By the time the battle was finished the high tide had passed
Then was it silke a slowde   in slackes full huge           Then was the water near the shore such a slush in very large pools
That let the king for to land   in the low water.           That the king could not land in the low water
For-thy he lenged on laye   for lesing of horses,           Therefore, he remained on the deep water for fear of losing his horses
To look of his lege-men   and of his lele knightes,
Yif any were lamed or lost,   live yif they sholde.
Then Sir Gawain the good   a galley he takes
And glides up at a gole   with good men of armes;           small bay (gully)
When he grounded, for gref   he girdes in the water           ran aground; leaps
That to the girdle he goes   in all his gilt weedes,
Shootes up upon the sand   in sight of the lordes,           Rushes
Singly with his soppe,   my sorrow is the more!           Alone; small troop
With banners of his badges,   best of his armes,           heraldic devices
He braides up on the bank   in his bright weedes;
He biddes his banneour:   ""Busk thou belive           banner bearer; Go quickly
To yon brode batail   that on yon bank hoves,
And I ensure you soothe   I shall you sew after;           follow
Look ye blenk for no brand   ne for no bright wepen,           blanch
But beres down of the best   and bring them o-dawe!           out of daylight
Bes not abaist of their boste,   abide on the erthe;           Be; abashed
Ye have my banneres borne   in batailes full huge;
We shall fell yon false,   the fend have their soules!
Fightes fast with the frap,   the feld shall be oures!           company
May I that traitour over-take,   torfer him tides           If I can; woe
That this tresoun has timbered   to my trew lord!           built for
Of such a engendure   full little joy happens,           engendering
And that shall in this journee   be judged full even!""
Now they seek over the sand,   this soppe at the gainest,           small troop
Sembles on the soudeours   and settes their dintes;           Attack; set out
Through the sheldes so sheen   shalkes they touch
With shaftes shivered short   of those sheen launces;           broken
Derf dintes they delt   with daggand speres;           piercing
On the dank of the dew   many dede ligges,
Dukes and douspeeres   and dubbed knightes;
The doughtiest of Danemark   undone are forever!
Thus those renkes in rewth   rittes their brenyes           rip
And reches of the richest   unrecken dintes,           give; countless
There they throng in the thick   and thrustes to the erthe
Of the throest men   three hundreth at ones!
But Sir Gawain for gref   might not again-stand,           withstand
Umbegrippes a spere   and to a gome runnes,           Grasps
That bore of gules full gay   with goutes of silver;           arms of red; droplets
He girdes him in at the gorge   with his grim launce           throat
That the grounden glaive   graithes in sonder;           point
With that bustous blade   he bounes him to die!           prepares himself
The King of Gotheland it was,   a good man of armes.           Gothland (South Sweden)
Their avauntward then all   voides there-after,           vanguard
Als vanquist verrayly   with valiant bernes;           vanquished; verily
Meetes with middle-ward   that Mordred ledes;           middle guard
Our men merkes them to,   as them mishappened,           advance toward
For had Sir Gawain the grace   to hold the green hill,
He had worship, iwis,   wonnen forever!
But then Sir Gawain, iwis,   he waites him well
To wreke on this warlaw   that this war moved,           warlock
And merkes to Sir Mordred   among all his bernes,
With the Montagues   and other grete lordes.
Then Sir Gawain was greved   and with a grete will
Fewters a fair spere   and freshly ascries:
""False fostered fode,   the fend have thy bones!           creature; fiend
Fy on thee, felon,   and thy false workes!
Thou shall be dede and undone   for thy derf deedes,
Or I shall die this day,   if destainy worthe!""           if it be my destiny
Then his enmy with host   of outlawed bernes
All enangles about   our excellent knightes           Surrounds
That the traitour by tresoun   had tried himselven;           experienced
Dukes of Danemark   he dightes full soon,           marshals
And leders of Lettow   with legions ynow,           Lithuania
Umbelapped our men   with launces full keen,           Surrounded
Soudeours and Sarazenes   out of sere landes,
Sixty thousand men,   seemlyly arrayed,
Sekerly assembles there   on seven score knightes,
Sodenly in dischaite   by tho salt strandes.           deceit
Then Sir Gawain grette   with his grey eyen           wept
For gref of his good men   that he guide sholde.
He wiste that they wounded were   and wery for-foughten,           exhausted with fighting
And what for wonder and wo,   all his wit failed.
And then sighand he said   with syland teres:           flowing tears
""We are with Sarazenes beset   upon sere halves!
I sigh not for myself,   so help our Lord,
But for to see us surprised   my sorrow is the more!           captured
Bes doughty today,   yon dukes shall be yours!           Be
For dere Drighten this day   dredes no wepen.
We shall end this day   als excellent knightes,
Ayer to endless joy   with angeles unwemmed;           Go; spotless
Though we have unwittyly   wasted ourselven,           unwisely
We shall work all well   in the worship of Crist!
We shall for yon Sarazenes,   I seker you my trewth,           pledge
Soupe with our Saviour   solemnly in heven,           Dine
In presence of that Precious,   Prince of all other,
With prophetes and patriarkes   and apostles full noble,
Before His freelich face   that formed us all!
Yonder to yon yaldsones!   He that yeldes him ever           whore sons
Whiles he is quick and in quert,   unquelled with handes,           alive; sound health
Be he never mo saved,   ne succoured with Crist,
But Satanase his soul   mowe sink into Hell!""           may
Then grimly Sir Gawain   grippes his wepen;
Again that grete batail   he graithes him soon,
Radly of his rich sword   he rightes the chaines;           Quickly; cuts
In he shockes his sheld,   shuntes he no lenger,           pushes; hangs back
But all unwise, wodewise,   he went at the gainest,           madly
Woundes of those widerwinnes   with wrakful dintes;           enemies; wrathful
All welles full of blood   there he away passes;
And though him were full wo,   he wondes but little,           hesitates
But wrekes at his worship   the wrath of his lord!
He stickes steedes in stour   and sterenfull knightes,           pierces; stern
That steren men in the stirrupes   stone-dede they ligge!
He rives the rank steel,   he rittes the mailes;           cleaves; rips
There might no renk him arrest;   his resoun was passed!
He fell in a frensy   for fersness of herte;           frenzy
He fightes and felles down   that him before standes!
Fell never fey man   such fortune in erthe!           Befell; a fated man
Into the hole batail   hedlings he runnes           headlong
And hurtes of the hardiest   that on the erthe lenges;
Letand as a lion   he launches them through,           Acting like; stabs
Lordes and leders   that on the land hoves.           stand
Yet Sir Wawain for wo   wondes but little,           hesitates
But woundes of those widerwinnes   with wonderful dintes,           enemies
Als he that wolde wilfully   wasten himselven,
And for wondsome and will   all his wit failed,           fierceness; willfulness
That wode als a wild beste   he went at the gainest;           crazy
All wallowed on blood   there he away passed;
Ich a wye may be ware   by wreke of another!           Each man may be warned by vengeance wreaked on another
Then he moves to Sir Mordred   among all his knightes,
And met him in the mid-sheld   and malles him through,           hammers
But the shalk for the sharp   he shuntes a little;           hangs back
He share him on the short ribbes   a shaftmond large.           cut; six inches deep
The shaft shuddered and shot   in the shire berne           dashed; shining
That the sheddand blood   over his shank runnes           leg
And shewed on his shin-bawde   that was shire burnisht!           shin-plate; brightly
And so they shift and shove   he shot to the erthe,           as; fell precipitously
With the lush of the launce   he light on his shoulders           blow; i.e., Mordred
An acre-lenghe on a laund   full lothly wounded.           full length; hillock
Then Gawain gird to the gome   and on the grouf falles;           leaps; on his face
All his gref was graithed;   his grace was no better!           destined
He shockes out a short knife   shethed with silver           draws; sheathed
And sholde have slotted him in   but no slit happened;           stabbed
His hand slipped and slode   o-slant on the mailes           slid; aslant
And the tother slely   slinges him under;           the other slyly
With a trenchand knife   the traitour him hittes           cutting
Through the helm and the hed   on high on the brain;
And thus Sir Gawain is gone,   the good man of armes,
Withouten rescue of renk,   and rew is the more!           pity
Thus Sir Gawain is gone   that guied many other;           guided
Fro Gower to Gernesay,   all the grete lordes           Guernsey
Of Glamour, of Galys land,   these galiard knightes           Glamorgan; Wales
For glent of glopining   glad be they never!           sight of horror
King Frederik   of Fres   faithly there-after           Frisia faithfully
Fraines at the false man   of our fers knight:           Inquires of
""Knew thou ever this knight   in thy kith rich?
Of what kind he was comen   beknow now the sooth;           family
What gome was he,   this with the gay armes,
With this griffon of gold,   that is on grouf fallen?           on his face
He has gretly greved us,   so me God help,
Gird down our good men   and greved us sore!           Struck
He was the sterenest in stour   that ever steel wered,           wore
For he stonayed our stale   and stroyed for ever!""           troop
Then Sir Mordred with mouth   meles full fair:
""He was makless on molde,   man, by my trewth.           matchless
This was Sir Gawain the good,   the gladdest of other,
And the graciousest gome   that under God lived,
Man hardiest of hand,   happiest in armes,           most fortunate
And the hendest in hall   under heven-rich,           the kingdom of heaven
And the lordliest in leding   whiles he live might,           leadership
For he was lion alosed   in landes ynow;           praised as
Had thou knowen him, Sir King,   in kithe there he lenged,
His cunning, his knighthood,   his kindly workes,
His doing, his doughtiness,   his deedes of armes,
Thou wolde have dole for his dede   the dayes of thy life.""           grieved
Yet that traitour als tite   teres let he fall,           at once
Turnes him forth tite   and talkes no more,           quickly
Went weepand away   and weryes the stounde           curses the time
That ever his werdes were wrought   such wandreth to work!           fates; misery
When he thought on this thing   it thirled his herte;           pierced
For sake of his sib-blood   sighand he rides;           kinship
When that renayed renk   remembered himselven           renegade
Of reverence and riotes   of the Round Table,
He romed and repent him   of all his rewth workes,           moaned; foul deeds
Rode away with his rout,   restes he no lenger,
For rade of our rich king,   rive that he sholde.           fear; arrive; might
Then kaires he to Cornwall,   care-full in herte,           goes
Because of his kinsman   that on the coste ligges;
He tarries trembland ay,   tidandes to herken.
Then the traitour treunted   the Tuesday there-after,           set forth
Trines in with a trayn   tresoun to work,           Goes; trick
And by the Tamber that tide   his tentes he reres,           the River Tamar
And then in a mett-while   a messanger he sendes           short time
And wrote unto Waynor   how the world changed
And what comlich coste   the king was arrived,
On flood foughten with his fleet   and felled them o life;           from
Bade her ferken o-fer   and flee with her childer           hasten afar
Whiles he might wile him away   and win to her speche,           Until he could get away by stealth and come to speak to her
Ayer into Ireland,   into those oute-mountes,           outer mountains
And wonne there in wilderness   within tho waste landes.           live; deserted
Then sho yermes and yeyes   at York in her chamber,           cries; sobs
Grones full grisly   with gretand teres,           weeping
Passes out of the palais   with all her pris maidens,
Toward Chester in a charre   they chese her the wayes,           carriage
Dight her even for to die   with dole at her herte;
Sho kaires to Caerlion   and caught her a veil,           i.e., became a nun
Askes there the habit   in honour of Crist           nun's garment
And all for falshed and fraud   and fere of her lord!           falsehood; fear; husband
But when our wise king wiste   that Gawain was landed,
He al to-writhes for wo,   and wringand his handes,           writhes violently
Gars launch his botes   upon a low water,           Gives orders to
Landes als a lion   with lordlich knightes,
Slippes in the sloppes   o-slant to the girdle,           pools aslant
Swalters up swiftly   with his sword drawen,           Splashes
Bounes his batail   and banners displayes,
Buskes over the brode sand   with brethe at his herte,
Ferkes frely on feld   there the fey ligges;
Of the traitours men   on trapped steedes,
Ten thousand were tint,   the trewth to account,           slain
And, certain, on our side   seven score knightes,
In suite with their soveraign   unsound are beleved.           Together; not whole (dead)
The king comly overcast   knightes and other,           turned over
Erles of Afrike   and Estriche bernes,           Austrian
Of Argyle and Orkney   the Irish kinges,
The noblest of Norway, numbers full huge,
Dukes and Danemarkes   and dubbed knightes;
And the Guthede king   in the gay armes           Gothic
Lies gronand on the ground   and gird through even.
The rich king ransackes   with rewth at his herte           searches
And up rippes the renkes   of all the Round Table,           pulls
Sees them all in a soppe   in suite by them one           little group together
With the Sarazenes unsound   encircled about,           dead
And Sir Gawain the good   in his gay armes,
Umbegripped the gers   and on grouf fallen,           Clutched; grass; face down
His banners braiden down,   beten of gules,           adorned with red
His brand and his brode sheld   all bloody berunnen.           run over
Was never our seemlich king   so sorrowful in herte,
Ne that sank him so sad   but that sight one.           Nor was there anything that sank him so sad as that sight alone
Then gliftes the good king   and glopins in herte,           stares; is terror-struck
Grones full grislich   with gretande teres,           weeping
Kneeles down to the corse   and caught it in armes,           corpse
Castes up his umbrere   and kisses him soon,           visor
Lookes on his eye-liddes   that locked were fair,
His lippes like to the lede   and his lire fallowed.           lead; complexion pale
Then the crownd king   cries full loud:
""Dere cosin of kind   in care am I leved,           blood relative
For now my worship is went   and my war ended!
Here is the hope of my hele,   my happing in armes,           well-being; good fortune
My herte and my hardiness   holly on him lenged!
My counsel, my comfort,   that keeped mine herte!
Of all knightes the king   that under Crist lived!
Thou was worthy to be king,   though I the crown bare!
My wele and my worship   of all this world rich           wealth
Was wonnen through Sir Gawain   and through his wit one!           only
""Alas,"" said Sir Arthur,   ""now eekes my sorrow!           increases
I am utterly undone   in mine owen landes!
A doutous, derf dede,   thou dwelles too long!           fearful, cruel death
Why drawes thou so on dregh?   Thou drownes mine herte!""           delay; so long
Then sweltes the sweet king   and in swoon falles,           faints
Swafres up swiftly   and sweetly him kisses           Staggers
Til his burlich berde   was bloody berunnen,           covered with blood
Als he had bestes brittened   and brought out of life;           beasts
Ne had Sir Ewain comen   and other grete lordes,
His bold herte had bristen   for bale at that stounde!           time
""Blinn,"" says these bold men,   ""thou blunders thyselven!           Stop; harms
This is bootless bale,   for better bes it never!           without remedy; will be
It is no worship, iwis,   to wring thine handes;
To weep als a woman   it is no wit holden!
Be knightly of countenaunce,   als a king sholde,
And leve such clamour,   for Cristes love of heven!""
""For blood,"" says the bold king,   ""blinn shall I never           cease
Ere my brain to-brist   or my breste other!           shatter; either
Was never sorrow so soft   that sank to my herte;
It is full sib to myself;   my sorrow is the more.           closely related
Was never so sorrowful a sight   seen with mine eyen!
He is sakless surprised   for sin of mine one!""           innocent
Down kneeles the king   and cries full loud,
With care-full countenaunce   he carpes these wordes:
""O rightwise rich God,   this rewth thou behold,           righteous
This real red blood   run upon erthe!
It were worthy to be shrede   and shrined in gold,           clothed; enshrined
For it is sakless of sin,   so help me our Lord!""           innocent
Down kneeles the king   with care at his herte,
Caught it up kindly   with his clene handes,
Cast it in a kettle-hat   and coverd it fair,
And kaires forth with the corse   in kithe there he lenges.
""Here I make mine avow,""   quod the king then,
""To Messie and to Mary,   the mild Queen of heven:           Messiah
I shall never rivaye   ne ratches uncouple,           hunt; hounds unleash
At roe ne rein-dere   that runnes upon erthe,           reindeer
Never greyhound let glide,   ne gossehawk let fly           goshawk
Ne never fowl see felled   that flighes with wing,           flies
Faucon ne formel   upon fist handle           Falcon; female hawk
Ne yet with gerefaucon   rejoice me in erthe,           gerfalcon
Ne regne in my royaltees,   ne hold my Round Table,
Til thy dede, my dere,   be duly revenged!           death; beloved
But ever droop and dare   whiles my life lastes,           lie still
Til Drighten and derf dede   have done what them likes!""           the Lord; cruel death
Then caught they up the corse   with care at their hertes,
Carried it on a courser   with the king selven;
The way unto Winchester   they went at the gainest,           by the shortest route
Wery and wandsomly   with wounded knightes;           sorrowfully
There come the prior of the place   and professed monkes,
A-pas in procession,   and with the prince meetes,           Quickly
And he betook them the corse   of the knight noble:           entrusted to
""Lookes it be clenly keeped,"" he said,   ""and in the kirk holden;           church
Don for him diriges,   as to the dede falles,           Do; benefits
Mensked with masses   for meed of the soul;           Honoured; reward
Look it want no wax,   ne no worship elles,           See that; lack; candles
And that the body be baumed   and on erthe holden;           embalmed
Yif thou keep thy covent,   encroch any worship           promise, claim; reward
At my coming again,   yif Crist will it thole;           allow
Abide of the burying   til they be brought under           Wait for
That has wrought us this wo   and this war moved.""
Then says Sir Wichere the wye,   a wise man of armes:
""I rede ye warily wend   and workes the best,
Sujourn in this citee   and semble thy bernes,
And bide with thy bold men   in the burgh rich;
Get out knightes of countrees   that castels holdes,           Get knights who hold your castles from their countries
And out of garrisons grete   good men of armes,
For we are faithly too few   to fight with them all
That we see in his sorte   upon the se bankes.           saw
With cruel countenaunce then   the king carpes these wordes:
""I pray thee care not, sir knight,   ne cast thou no dredes!           imagine
Had I no segge but myself   one under sun,
And I may him see with sight   or on him set handes,
I shall even among his men   malle him to dede,           hammer
Ere I of the stede stir   half a steed lenghe!           place
I shall strike him in his stour   and stroy him forever,
And there-to make I mine avow   devotly to Crist           devoutly
And to his moder Mary,   the mild Queen of heven!
I shall never sujourn sound,   ne saught at mine herte,           nor have peace
In citee ne in suburb   set upon erthe,
Ne yet slomour ne sleep   with my slow eyen,           slumber; heavy
Til he be slain that him slogh,   if any sleight happen,           slew; chance
But ever persew the paganes   that my pople destroyed           pursue
Whiles I may pare them and pinne   in place there me likes.""           hurt; imprison
There durst no renk him arrest   of all the Round Table,           stop
Ne none pay that prince   with plesand wordes,           pacify; pleasing
Ne none of his lege-men   look him in the eyen,
So lordly he lookes   for loss of his knightes!
Then drawes he to Dorset   and dreches no lenger,           hesitates
Dref-ful, dredless,   with droopand teres,           Sorrowful, doubtless
Kaires into Cornwall   with care at his herte;           Proceeds
The trace of the traitour   he trines full even,           follows
And turnes in by the Trentis   the traitour to seek,           the River Trent
Findes him in a forest    the Friday there-after;
The king lightes on foot   and freshly ascries,
And with his freelich folk   he has the feld nomen!           taken
Now isshewes his enmy   under the wood eves           issues out
With hostes of alienes   full horrible to shew!
Sir Mordred the Malbranche,   with his much pople,           Ill-begotten
Foundes out of the forest   upon fele halves,           Comes
In seven grete batailes   seemlich arrayed,
Sixty thousand men - the sight was full huge -
All fightand folk   of the fer landes,
Fair fitted on front   by tho fresh strandes.           arranged
And all Arthurs host   was amed with knightes           reckoned by
But eighteen hundreth of all,   enterd in rolles.
This was a match un-mete,   but mightes of Crist,           unequal, save for
To melle with that multitude   in those main landes.           fight
Then the royal roy   of the Round Table
Rides on a rich steed,   arrayes his bernes,
Buskes his avauntward,   als him best likes;
Sir Ewain and Sir Errak,   and other grete lordes
Demenes the middle-ward   menskfully there-after,           Command
With Merrak and Meneduke,   mighty of strenghes;
Idrous and Alymer,   thir avenaunt children,
Ayers with Arthur   with seven-score of knightes;           Proceed
He rewles the rereward   redyly there-after,
The rekenest redy men   of the Round Table;           most active
And thus he fittes his folk   and freshly ascries,
And senn comfortes his men   with knightlich wordes:
""I beseek you, sirs,   for sake of our Lord,
That ye do well today   and dredes no wepen!
Fightes fersly now   and fendes yourselven,           defend
Felles down yon fey folk,   the feld shall be ours!           fated
They are Sarazenes, yon sorte,   unsound mot they worthe!           may they be
Set on them sadly   for sake of our Lord!
Yif us be destained to die   today on this erthe,           destined
We shall be heved unto heven   ere we be half cold!           lifted
Look ye let for no lede   lordly to work;
Layes yon laddes low   by the laike end;           end of the game
Take no tent unto me,   ne tale of me recke;           Pay no attention; believe
Bes busy on my banners   with your bright wepens,           Be; around
That they be strenghely stuffed   with steren knightes           strongly provided
And holden lordly on-loft   ledes to shew;
Yif any renk them arase,   rescue them soon;           is captured by them
Workes now my worship;   today my war endes!
Ye wot my wele and my wo;   workes as you likes!
Crist comly with crown   comfort you all
For the kindest creatures   that ever king led!
I give you all my blessing   with a blithe will,
And all Bretons bold,   blithe mot ye worthe!""           may you be glad
They pipe up at prime time,   approches them ner,           9 A.M., approach; nearer
Pris men and preste   proves their strenghes;           Choice; ready
Bremly the brethe-men   bragges in trumpes,           Boldly; buglers; blow
In coronettes comlyly,   when knightes assembles;           horns
And then jollyly enjoines   these gentle knightes;           join battle
A jollier journee   ajudged was never,
When Bretones boldly   enbraces their sheldes,           put on (their arms)
And Cristen encrossed them   and castes in fewter!           Christians crossed themselves
Then Sir Arthur host   his enmy escries,           sees
And in they shock their sheldes,   shuntes no lenger,           thrust; delay
Shot to the sheltrones   and shoutes full high;           troops
Through sheldes full sheen   shalkes they touch!
Redily those rydde men   of the Round Table           fierce
With real rank steel   rittes their mailes;           rip
Brenyes brouden they brist   and burnisht helmes,           woven
Hewes hethen men down,   halses in sonder!           necks
Fightand with fine steel   the fey blood runnes;
Of the frekkest on front   un-fers are beleved.           unfierce (i.e., defeated)
Hethenes of Argyle   and Irish kinges
Enverounes our avauntward   with venomous bernes,           Surrounds
Peghtes and paynimes   with perilous wepens,           Picts
With speres dispitously   despoiles our knightes           pitilessly
And hewed down the hendest   with hertly dintes!           mortal blows
Through the hole batail   they holden their wayes;
Thus fersly they fight   upon sere halves,           various sides
That of the bold Bretons   much blood spilles;
There durst none rescue them   for riches in erthe,           dared
The steren were there so stedde   and stuffed with other;           beset; hard-pressed
He durst not stir a step,   but stood for himselven,           i.e., Arthur
Til three stales were stroyed   by strenghe of him one!           detachments
""Idrous,"" quod Arthur,   ""ayer thee behooves!
I see Sir Ewain over-set   with Sarazenes keen!
Redy thee for rescues,   array thee soon!
Hie thee with hardy men   in help of thy fader!
Set in on the side   and succour yon lordes!
But they be succoured and sound,   unsaught be I ever!""           safe; troubled
Idrous him answers   ernestly there-after:
""He is my fader, in faith,   forsake shall I never -
He has me fostered and fed   and my fair brethern -
But I forsake this gate,   so me God help,           going (to his aid)
And soothly all sibreden   but thyself one.           kinship
I broke never his bidding   for berne on life,           command
But ever buxom as beste   blithely to work.           (was) obedient as a beast
He commaund me kindly   with knightly wordes,
That I sholde lely on thee lenge,   and on no lede elles;
I shall his commaundment hold,   if Crist will me thole!           allow
He is elder than I,   and end shall we bothen;
He shall ferk before,   and I shall come after;
Yif him be destained to die   today on this erthe,           destined
Crist, comly with crown,   take keep to his soul!""
Then romes the rich king   with rewth at his herte,           cries; grief
Heves his handes on height   and to the Heven lookes:           Lifts
""Why then ne had Drighten   destained at His dere will           Why did the Lord not destine (me to die) at His dear will
That He had deemed me today   to die for you all?           ordered
That had I lever than be lord   all my life-time
Of all that Alexander ought   whiles he in erthe lenged!""
Sir Ewain and Sir Errak,   these excellent bernes,
Enters in on the host   and egerly strikes;
The hethenes of Orkney   and Irish kinges
They gobone of the gretest   with grounden swordes,           i.e., Ewain and Errak; chop
Hewes on those hulkes   with their hard wepens,
Layed down those ledes   with lothly dintes;           Laid
Shoulders and sheldes   they shrede to the haunches,
And middles through mailes   they merken in sonder!           midriffs; cut
Such honour never ought   none erthly kinges
At their ending day   but Arthur himselven!
So the drought of the day   dryed their hertes
That both drinkless they die;   dole was the more!
Now melles our middle-ward   and mengen togeder.           attacks; mingles
Sir Mordred the Malbranche   with his much pople,           Ill-begotten; great army
He had hid him behind   within these holt eves,
With hole batail on hethe,   harm is the more!           whole battalion; heath
He had seen the contek   all clene to the end,           conflict
How our chevalry cheved   by chaunces of armes;           fared
He wiste our folk was for-foughten   that there was fey leved;           outfought
To encounter the king   he castes him soon,           plans
But the cherles chicken   had changed his armes;           churlish offspring
He had soothly forsaken   the sauturour engreled,           saltire engrailed
And laght up three lions   all of white silver,           taken
Passand in purpure   of perry full rich,           Passant on a purple background of very rich jewels
For the king sholde not know   the cautelous wretch.           cunning
Because of his cowardice   he cast off his attire;           heraldic device
But the comlich king   knew him full swithe,
Carpes to Sir Cador   these kindly wordes:
""I see the traitour come yonder   trinand full yerne;           going
Yon lad with the lions   is like to himselven;
Him shall torfer betide,   may I touch ones,           woe; if I can
For all his tresoun and trayn,   als I am trew lord!           trickery
Today Clarent and Caliburn   shall kithe them togeders           Excalibur; make known
Whilk is keener of carfe   or harder of edge!           Which; carving
Fraist shall we fine steel upon fine weedes.           Test
It was my darling dainteous   and full dere holden,           i.e., the sword Clarent; dainty
Keeped for encrownmentes   of kinges annointed;           coronations
On dayes when I dubbed   dukes and erles
It was burlich borne   by the bright hiltes;
I durst never dere it   in deedes of armes           harm
But ever keeped clene   because of myselven.
For I see Clarent uncledde   that crown is of swordes,           i.e., drawn
My wardrope at Walingford   I wot is destroyed.           wardrobe
Wiste no wye of wonne   but Waynor herselven;           Knew; the dwelling place
Sho had the keeping herself   of that kidd wepen,
Of coffers enclosed   that to the crown longed,
With ringes and relickes   and the regale of Fraunce           regalia
That was founden on Sir Frolle   when he was fey leved.""           left dead
Then Sir Marrak in malencoly   meetes him soon,           melancholy
With a malled mace   mightyly him strikes;           hammered
The bordour of his bacenett   he bristes in sonder,           border; helmet
That the shire red blood   over his breny runnes!
The berne blenkes for bale   and all his blee changes,           blanches; complexion
But yet he bides as a bore   and bremly he strikes!           boar; fiercely
He braides out a brand   bright als ever any silver           i.e., Mordred
That was Sir Arthur owen,   and Utere his faders,
In the wardrope at Walingford   was wont to be keeped;           wardrobe
Therewith the derf dog   such dintes he reched           impudent
The tother withdrew on dregh   and drust do none other           other; back
For Sir Marrak was man   marred in elde,           weakened by age
And Sir Mordred was mighty   and in his most strenghes;
Come none within the compass,   knight ne none other,
Within the swing of sword,   that he ne the swet leved.           life-blood left
That perceives our prince   and presses to fast,           i.e., to battle
Strikes into the stour   by strenghe of his handes,           melee
Meetes with Sir Mordred;   he meles unfair:           speaks gruffly
""Turn, traitour untrew,   thee tides no better;
By grete God, thou shall die   with dint of my handes!
Thee shall rescue no renk   ne riches in erthe!""
The king with Caliburn   knightly him strikes;
The cantel of his clere sheld   he carves in sonder,           cornerpiece
Into the shoulder of the shalk   a shaftmonde large           six inches deep
That the shire red blood   shewed on the mailes!
He shuddered and shrinkes   and shuntes but little,
But shockes in sharply   in his sheen weedes;
The felon with the fine sword   freshly he strikes,
The felettes of the ferrer side   he flashes in sonder,           rib plates; farther
Through jupon and gesseraunt   of gentle mailes,           gipon (tunic); hauberk
The freke fiched in the flesh   an half-foot large;           pierced
That derf dint was his dede,   and dole was the more           hideous blow
That ever that doughty sholde die   but at Drightens will!
Yet with Caliburn his sword   full knightly he strikes,
Castes in his clere sheld   and coveres him full fair,
Swappes off the sword hand,   als he by glentes -           goes
An inch fro the elbow   he oched it in sonder           chopped
That he swoones on the swarth   and on swim falles -           turf; swoon
Through bracer of brown steel   and the bright mailes,           armguard
That the hilt and the hand   upon the hethe ligges.
Then freshlich the freke   the fente up-reres,           Arthur; vent raises
Broches him in with the brand   to the bright hiltes,
And he brawles on the brand   and bounes for to die.           struggles
""In faye,"" said the fey king,   ""sore me for-thinkes           I sorely repent
That ever such a false thef   so fair an end haves.""           thief
When they had finisht this fight,   then was the feld wonnen,
And the false folk in the feld   fey are beleved!
Til a forest they fled   and fell in the greves,           groves
And fers fightand folk   followes them after,
Huntes and hewes down   the hethen tikes,           heathen dogs
Murtheres in the mountaines   Sir Mordred knightes;           Murder
There chaped never no child,   cheftain ne other,           escaped
But choppes them down in the chase;   it charges but little!           troubles
But when Sir Arthur anon   Sir Ewain he findes,
And Errak the avenaunt   and other grete lordes,           comely
He caught up Sir Cador   with care at his herte,
Sir Clegis, Sir Cleremond,   these clere men of armes,
Sir Lot and Sir Lionel,   Sir Launcelot and Lowes,
Marrak and Meneduke,   that mighty were ever;
With langour in the land   there he layes them togeder,
Looked on their lighames,   and with a loud steven,           bodies; voice
Als lede that list not live   and lost had his mirthes -           man; desired
Then he stotays for mad   and all his strenghe failes,           staggers; dizziness
Lookes up to the lift   and all his lire changes,           sky; face
Down he sways full swithe,   and in a swoon falles,
Up he coveres on knees   and cries full often -
""King, comly with crown,   in care am I leved!
All my lordship low   in land is laid under,
That me has given guerdones,   by grace of Himselven,           rewards
Maintained my manhed   by might of their handes,           manhood
Made me manly on molde   and master in erthe,
In a teenful time   this torfer was rered,           painful; mischief; raised
That for a traitour has tint   all my trew lordes!           destroyed
Here restes the rich blood   of the Round Table,
Rebuked with a rebaud,   and rewth is the more!           scoundrel
I may helpless on hethe   house by mine one,
Als a woful widow   that wantes her berne!           children
I may werye and weep   and wring mine handes,           curse
For my wit and my worship   away is forever!
Of all lordshippes I take   leve to mine end!
Here is the Bretones blood   brought out of life,
And now in this journee   all my joy endes!""
Then relies the renks   of all the Round Table;           rally
To the real roy   they ride them all;
Then assembles full soon   seven score knightes
In sight to their soveraign   that was unsound leved;
Then kneeles the crowned king   and cries on loud:
""I thank thee, God, of thy grace,   with a good will,
That gave us vertue and wit   to venquish these bernes,
And us has graunted the gree   of these grete lordes!           victory over
He sent us never no shame   ne shenship in erthe           disgrace
But ever yet the over-hand   of all other kinges;           i.e., upper hand
We have no leisere now   these lordes to seek,           leisure
For yon lothly lad   me lamed so sore!           i.e., Mordred
Graith us to Glashenbury;   us gaines none other;           Let us go to Glastonbury; nothing else avails
There we may rest us with roo   and ransack our woundes.           peace; treat
Of this dere day work   the Drighten be lowed,           costly; praised
That us has detained and deemed   to die in our owen.""           i.e., in our own land
Then they hold at his hest   holly at ones,           command
And graithes to Glashenbury   the gate at the gainest;           Glastonbury; way
Entres the Ile of Avalon   and Arthur he lightes,           Isle
Merkes to a manor there,   for might he no further;           for he could go
A surgen of Salerne   enserches his woundes;           surgeon; treats
The king sees by assay   that sound bes he never,           examination; will be
And soon to his seker men   he said these wordes:           true
""Do call me a confessor   with Crist in his armes;           i.e., the Eucharist
I will be houseld in haste   what hap so betides.           given the sacrament
Constantine my cosin   he shall the crown bere,
Als becomes him of kind,   if Crist will him thole!           allow
Berne, for my benison,   thou bury yon lordes           blessing
That in batail with brandes   are brought out of life,
And sithen merk manly   to Mordred children,           pursue manfully
That they be slely slain   and slongen in waters;           wisely; slung
Let no wicked weed wax   ne writhe on this erthe;           grow nor flourish
I warn, for thy worship,   work als I bid!
I forgive all gref,   for Cristes love of heven!
If Waynor have well wrought,   well her betide!""
He said ""In manus"" with main   on molde where he ligges,           ""Into Your hands""
And thus passes his spirit   and spekes he no more!
The baronage of Bretain then,   bishoppes and other,
Graithes them to Glashenbury   with glopinand hertes           Glastonbury; dismayed
To bury there the bold king   and bring to the erthe
With all worhsip and welth   that any wye sholde.           person should have
Throly belles they ring   and Requiem singes,           Loudly
Dos masses and matins   with mornand notes;           Do
Religious reveste   in their rich copes,           Monastics dressed
Pontificalles and prelates   in precious weedes,           Bishops
Dukes and douspeeres   in their dole-cotes,           mourning garments
Countesses kneeland   and claspand their handes,
Ladies languishand   and lowrand to shew;           frowning
All was busked in black,   birdes and other,           dressed; women
That shewed at the sepulture   with syland teres;           sepulchre; flowing
Was never so sorrowful a sight   seen in their time!
Thus endes King Arthur,   as auctors allege,           authorities tell
That was of Ectores blude,   the kinge son of Troy           Hector's blood
And of Sir Priamous, the prince,   praised in erthe;           Priam
Fro thethen brought the Bretons   all his bold elders           thence (i.e., Troy)
Into Bretain the brode,   as the Brut telles.

Hic jacet Arthurus, rex quondam rexque futurus.

Start Me Up,Swagu,"8 ContributorsHole in My Head Lyrics
Let go!
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head, girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head, girl
You got a hole in my head
You got a hole in my head, girl

No use, your lips keep moving
But I got a couple of screws loose
Them other boys talkin' about me
They say I'm bad news
And probably best for you to keep this short
It's my time to interrupt
Gonna take a lot to start me up
I don't think you wanna deal right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a gun on me
I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
You're gonna drown

All over your radio, see me in the stadium
I'll spin your body
Imma run to let these ladies know
Watch your tone around me
Don't push my buttons
You don't really wanna see me get wild
G-G-get wild
You might also like
I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

Buckle up, I ride this like a fast car
Suck it up, don't even try to act hard
And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me (With me)
Don't start with me (With me)
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down
Baby might drown
Catch me on your mind baby
Don't waste my time baby
Now watch me wine
You can take that as a sign baby
So left and right with me
Now push my buttons
You see me go wild
Go, go wild

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
(Oh, oh)
Watch me, watch me
(Oh, oh)
Sometimes I go crazy
(Oh, oh)
(Uh, uh, break it down) Oooh
I hear voices in my head, they go ""Oooh""
I hear voices in my head, they go ""Oooh""
I hear voices in my head, they go ""Oooh"" (Oh)
Uh, now go ""Oooh""
I hear voices in my head, they go ""Oooh""
I hear voices in my head, they go ""Oooh""
I hear voices in my head, they go ""Oooh"" (Oh)
Now go...

I got a hole in my head
A hole in my head
Sometimes I get crazy and I ain't scared of nobody
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
I got a hole in my head (M-my head, my head)
Don't look at me funny like you ain't hear what I said
I got a hole in my head (My head, my head)

She Bangs - English Edit,Ricky Martin,"3 ContributorsShe Bangs (English Edit) LyricsTalk to me
Tell me your name
You blow me off like it's all the same
You lit a fuse and now I'm ticking away
Like a bomb
Yeah, Baby
Talk to me
Tell me your sign
You're switching signs like a Gemini
You're playing games and now you're hittin' my heart
Like a drum
Yeah, Baby
Well if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
Till she knocks me out
She walks like she talks
And she talks like she walks
And she bangs, she bangs
Oh baby
When she moves, she moves
I go crazy
'Cause she looks like a flower but she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
You might also likeShe bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me that a woman's got one thing on her mind
Talk to me
Tell me your name
I'm just a link in your daisy chain
Your rap sounds like a diamond
Map to the stars
Yeah, Baby
Talk to me
Tell me the news
You wear me out like a pair of shoes
We'll dance until the band goes home
Then you're gone
Yeah, Baby
Well if it looks like love should be a crime
You'd better lock me up for life
I'll do the time with a smile on my face
Thinking of her in her leather and lace
And she bangs, she bangs
Oh baby
When she moves, she moves
I go crazy
'Cause she looks like a flower but she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
She bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine

Living on Applause,Furkoint,"2 ContributorsFinnegan’s Wake (Chap. 3.1) LyricsHark!
Tolv two elf kater ten (it can’t be) sax.
Hork!
Pedwar pemp foify tray (it must be) twelve.
And low stole o’er the stillness the heartbeats of sleep.
White fogbow spans. The arch embattled. Mark as capsules. The nose of the man who was nought like the nasoes. It is self tinted, wrinkling, ruddled. His kep is a gorsecone. He am Gascon Titubante of Tegmine — sub — Fagi whose fixtures are mobiling so wobiling befear my remembrandts. She, exhibit next, his Anastashie. She has prayings in lowdelph. Zeehere green egg-brooms. What named blautoothdmand is yon who stares? Gu — gurtha! Gugurtha! He has becco of wild hindigan. Ho, he hath hornhide! And hvis now is for you. Pens‚e! The most beautiful of woman of the veilch veilchen veilde. She would kidds to my voult of my palace, with obscidian luppas, her aal in her dhove’s suckling. Apagemonite! Come not nere! Black! Switch out !
Methought as I was dropping asleep somepart in nonland of where’s please (and it was when you and they were we) I heard at zero hour as ’twere the peal of vixen’s laughter among mid-night’s chimes from out the belfry of the cute old speckled church tolling so faint a goodmantrue as nighthood’s unseen violet rendered all animated greatbritish and Irish objects nonviewable to human watchers save ’twere perchance anon some glistery gleam darkling adown surface of affluvial flowandflow as again might seem garments of laundry reposing a leasward close at hand in full expectation. And as I was jogging along in a dream as dozing I was dawdling, arrah, methought broadtone was heard and the creepers and the gliders and flivvers of the earth breath and the dancetongues of the woodfires and the hummers in their ground all vociferated echoating: Shaun! Shaun! Post the post! with a high voice and O, the higher on high the deeper and low, I heard him so! And lo, mescemed somewhat came of the noise and somewho might amove allmurk. Now, ’twas as clump, now mayhap. When look, was light and now ’twas as flasher, now moren as the glaow. Ah, in unlitness ’twas in very similitude, bless me, ’twas his belted lamp! Whom we dreamt was a shaddo, sure, he’s lightseyes, the laddo! Blessed momence, O romence, he’s growing to stay! Ay, he who so swayed a will of a wisp before me, hand prop to hand, prompt side to the pros, dressed like an earl in just the correct wear, in a classy mac Frieze o’coat of far suparior ruggedness, indigo braw, tracked and tramped, and an Irish ferrier collar, freeswinging with mereswin lacers from his shoulthern and thick welted brogues on him hammered to suit the scotsmost public and climate, iron heels and sparable soles, and his jacket of providence wellprovided woolies with a softrolling lisp of a lapel to it and great sealingwax buttons, a good helping bigger than the slots for them, of twentytwo carrot krasnapopp-sky red and his invulnerable burlap whiskcoat and his popular choker, Tamagnum sette-and-forte and his loud boheem toy and the damasker’s overshirt he sported inside, a starspangled zephyr with a decidedly surpliced crinklydoodle front with his motto through dear life embrothred over it in peas, rice, and yeggy-yolk, Or for royal, Am for Mail, R.M.D. hard cash on the nail and the most successfully carried gigot turnups now you ever, (what a pairfact crease! how amsolookly kersse!) breaking over the ankle and hugging the shoeheel, everything the best — none other from (Ah, then may the turtle’s blessings of God and Mary and Haggispatrick and Huggisbrigid be souptumbling all over him!) other than (and may his hundred thousand welcome stewed letters, relayed wand postchased, multiply, ay faith, and plultiply!) Shaun himself.
What a picture primitive!
Had I the concordant wiseheads of Messrs Gregory and Lyons alongside of Dr Tarpey’s and I dorsay the reverend Mr Mac Dougall’s, but I, poor ass, am but as their fourpart tinckler’s dun-key. Yet methought Shaun (holy messonger angels be uninter — ruptedly nudging him among and along the winding ways of random ever!) Shaun in proper person (now may all the blue-blacksliding constellations continue to shape his changeable time — table!) stood before me. And I pledge you my agricultural word by the hundred and sixty odds rods and cones of this even’s vision that young fellow looked the stuff, the Bel of Beaus’ Walk, a prime card if ever was! Pep? Now without deceit it is hardly too much to say he was looking grand, so fired smart, in much more than his usual health. No mistaking that beamish brow! There was one for you that ne’er would nunch with good Duke Humphrey but would aight through the months without a sign of an err in hem and then, otherwise rounding, fourale to the lees of Traroe. Those jehovial oyeglances! The heart of the rool! And hit the hencoop. He was immense, topping swell for he was after having a great time of it, a twentyfour hours every moment matters maltsight, in a porterhouse, scutfrank, if you want to know, Saint Lawzenge of Toole’s, the Wheel of Fortune, leave your clubs in the hall and wait on yourself, no chucks for wal-nut ketchups, Lazenby’s and Chutney graspis (the house the once queen of Bristol and Balrothery twice admired because her frumped door looked up Dacent Street) where in the sighed of lovely eyes while his knives of hearts made havoc he had re-cruited his strength by meals of spadefuls of mounded food, in anticipation of the faste of tablenapkins, constituting his three-partite pranzipal meals plus a collation, his breakfast of first, a bless us O blood and thirsthy orange, next, the half of a pint of becon with newled googs and a segment of riceplummy padding, met of sunder suigar and some cold forsoaken steak peatrefired from the batblack night o’erflown then, without prejuice to evectuals, came along merendally his stockpot dinner of a half a pound or round steak, very rare, Blong’s best from Portarlington’s Butchery, with a side of riceypeasy and Corkshire alla mellonge and bacon with (a little mar pliche!) a pair of chops and thrown in from the silver grid by the proprietoress of the roastery who lives on the hill and gaulusch gravy and pumpernickel to wolp up and a gorger’s bulby onion (Margareter, Margaretar Margarastican-deatar) and as well with second course and then finally, after his avalunch oclock snack at’ Appelredt’s or Kitzy Braten’s of saddlebag steak and a Botherhim with her old phoenix portar, jistr to gwen his gwistel and praties sweet and Irish too and mock gurgle to whistle his way through for the swallying, swp by swp, and he getting his tongue arount it and Boland’s broth broken into the bargain, to his regret his soupay avic nightcap, vitellusit, a carusal consistent with second course eyer and becon (the rich of) with broad beans, hig, steak, hag, pepper the diamond bone hotted up timmtomm and while’twas after that he scoffed a drake-ling snuggily stuffed following cold loin of veal more cabbage and in their green free state a clister of peas, soppositorily petty, last. P.S. but a fingerhot of rheingenever to give the Pax cum Spiri-tututu. Drily thankful. Burud and dulse and typureely jam, all free of charge, aman, and. And the best of wine avec. For his heart was as big as himself, so it was, ay, and bigger! While the loaves are aflowering and the nachtingale jugs. All St Jilian’s of Berry, hurrah there for tobies!

Mind you, nuckling down to nourritures, were they menuly some ham and jaffas, and I don’t mean to make the ingestion for the moment that he was guilbey of gulpable gluttony as regards chew-able boltaballs, but, biestings be biestings, and upon the whole, when not off his oats, given prelove appetite and postlove pricing good coup, goodcheap, were it thermidor oogst or floreal may while the whistling prairial roysters play, between gormandising and gourmeteering, he grubbed his tuck all right, deah smorregos, every time he was for doing dirt to a meal or felt like a bottle of ardilaun arongwith a smag of a lecker biss of a welldressed taart or. Though his net intrants wight weighed nought but a flyblow to his gross and ganz afterduepoise. And he was so jarvey jaunty with a romp of a schoolgirl’s completion sitting pretty over his Oyster Monday print face and he was plainly out on the ramp and mash, as you might say, for he sproke.
Overture and beginners!
When lo (whish, O whish!) mesaw mestreamed, as the green to the gred was flew, was flown, through deafths of durkness greengrown deeper I heard a voice, the voce of Shaun, vote of the Irish, voise from afar (and cert no purer puer palestrine e’er chanted panangelical mid the clouds of Tu es Petrus, not Michaeleen Kelly, not Mara O’Mario, and sure, what more numerose Italicuss ever rawsucked frish uov in urinal?), a brieze to Yverzone o’er the brozaozaozing sea, from Inchigeela call the way how it suspired (morepork! morepork!) to scented nightlife as softly as the loftly marconimasts from Clifden sough open tireless secrets (mauveport! mauveport!) to Nova Scotia’s listing sisterwands. Tubetube!
His handpalm lifted, his handshell cupped, his handsign pointed, his handheart mated, his handaxe risen, his handleaf fallen. Helpsome hand that holemost heals! What is het holy! It gested.
And it said:
— Alo, alass, aladdin, amobus! Does she lag soft fall means rest down? Shaun yawned, as his general address rehearsal, (that was antepropreviousday’s pigeons-ina-pie with rough dough for the carrier and the hash-say-ugh of overgestern pluzz the ‘stuesday’s shampain in his head, with the memories of the past and the hicnuncs of the present embelliching the musics of the futures from Miccheruni’s band) addressing himself ex alto and complaining with vocal discontent it was so close as of the fact the rag was up and of the briefs and billpasses, a houseful of deadheads, of him to dye his paddycoats to morn his hestern- most earning, his board in the swealth of his fate as, having moistened his manducators upon the quiet and scooping molars and grinders clean with his two fore fingers, he sank his hunk, dowanouet to resk at once, exhaust as winded hare, utterly spent, it was all he could do (disgusted with himself that the combined weight of his tons of iosals was a hundred men’s massed too much for him), upon the native heath he loved covered kneehigh with virgin bush, for who who e’er trod sod of Erin could ever sleep off the turf! Well, I’m liberally dished seeing myself in this trim! How all too unwordy am I, a mere mailman of peace, a poor loust hastehater of the first degree, the principot of Candia, no legs and a title, for such eminence, or unpro promenade rather, to be much more exact, as to be the bearer extraordinary of these postoomany missive on his majesty’s service while me and yous and them we’re extending us after the pattern of reposiveness! Weh is me, yeh is ye! I, the mightif beam maircanny, which bit his mirth too early or met his birth too late! It should of been my other with his leickname for he’s the head and I’m an everdevoting fiend of his. I can seeze tomirror in tosdays of yer when we lofobsed os so ker. Those sembal simon pumpkel pieman yers! We shared the twin chamber and we winked on the one wench and what Sim sobs todie I’ll reeve tomorry, for ’twill be, I have hopes of, Sam Dizzier’s feedst. Tune in, tune on, old Tighe, high, high, high, I’m thine owelglass. Be old! He looks rather thin, imitating me. I’m very fond of that other of mine. Fish hands Macsorley! Elien! Obsequies! Bonzeye! Isaac Egari’s Ass! We’re the music-hall pair that won the swimmyease bladdhers at the Guinness gala in Badeniveagh. I ought not to laugh with him on this stage. But he’ such a game loser! I lift my disk to him. Brass and reeds, brace and ready! How is your napper, Handy, and hownow does she stand? First he was living to feel what the eldest daughter she was panseying and last he was dying to know what old Madre Patriack does be up to. Take this John’s Lane in your toastingfourch. Shaun-ti and shaunti and shaunti again! And twelve coolinder moons! I am no helotwashipper but I revere her! For my own coant! She has studied! Piscisvendolor! You’re grace! Futs dronk of Wouldndom! But, Gemini, he’s looking frightfully thin! I heard the man Shee shinging in the pantry bay. Down among the dust-bins let him lie! Ear! Ear! Not ay! Eye! Eye! For I’m at the heart of it. Yet I cannot on my solemn merits as a recitativer recollect ever having done of anything of the kind to deserve of such. Not the phost of a nation! Nor by a long trollop! I just didn’t have the time to. Saint Anthony Guide!
— But have we until now ever besought you, dear Shaun, we remembered, who it was, good boy, to begin with, who out of symphony gave you the permit?
— Goodbye now, Shaun replied, with a voice pure as a church-mode, in echo rightdainty, with a good catlick tug at his coco — moss candylock, a foretaste in time of his cabbageous brain’s curlyflower. Athiacaro! Comb his tar odd gee sing your mower O meeow? Greet thee Good? How are them columbuses! Lard have mustard on them! Fatiguing, very fatiguing. Hobos hom-knees and the corveeture of my spine. Poumeerme! My heaviest crux and dairy lot it is, with a bed as hard as the thinkamuddles of the Greeks and a board as bare as a Roman altar. I’m off rabbited kitchens and relief porridgers. No later than a very few fortnichts since I was meeting on the Thinker’s Dam with a pair of men out of glasshouse whom I shuffled hands with named MacBlacks — I think their names is MacBlakes — from the Headfire Clump — and they were improving me and making me beliek no five hour factory life with insufficient emollient and industrial disabled for them that day o’gratises. I have the highest grati-fication by anuncing how I have it from whowho but Hagios Colleenkiller’s prophecies. After suns and moons, dews and wettings, thunders and fires, comes sabotag. Solvitur palum-ballando! Tilvido! Adie!
— Then, we explained, salve a tour, ambly andy, you possibly might be so by order?
— Forgive me, Shaun repeated from his liquid lipes, not what I wants to do a strike of work but it was condemned on me pre-mitially by Hireark Books and Chiefoverseer Cooks in their Eusebian Concordant Homilies and there does be a power com- ing over me that is put upon me from on high out of the book of breedings and so as it is becoming hairydittary I have of coerce nothing in view to look forward at unless it is Swann and beating the blindquarters out of my oldfellow’s orologium oloss olo — rium. A bad attack of maggot it feels like. ’Tis trope, custodian said. Almost might I say of myself, while keeping out of crime, I am now becoming about fed up be going circulating about them new hikler’s highways like them nameless souls, ercked and skorned and grizzild all over, till it’s rusty October in this bleak forest and was veribally complussed by thinking of the crater of some noted volcano or the Dublin river or the catchalot trouth subsi-as away out or to isolate i from my multiple Mes on the spits of Lumbage Island or bury meself, clogs, coolcellar and all, deep in my wineupon ponteen unless Morrissey’s colt could help me or the gander maybe at 49 as it is a tithe fish so it is, this pig’s stomach business, and where on dearth or in the miraculous meddle of this expending umniverse to turn since it came into my hands I am hopeless off course to be doing anything concerning.
— We expect you are, honest Shaun, we agreed, but from franking machines, limricked, that in the end it may well turn out, we hear to be you, our belated, who will bear these open letter. Speak to us of Emailia.
— As, Shaun replied patly, with tootlepick tact too and a down of his dampers, to that I have the gumpower and, by the benison of Barbe, that is a lock to say with everything, my be-loved.
— Would you mind telling us, Shaun honey, beg little big moreboy, we proposed to such a dear youth, where mostly are you able to work. Ah, you might! Whimper and we shall.
— Here! Shaun replied, while he was fondling one of his cowheel cuffs. There’s no sabbath for nomads and I mostly was able to walk, being too soft for work proper, sixty odd eilish mires a week between three masses a morn and two chaplets at eve. I am always telling those pedestriasts, my answerers, Top, Sid and Hucky, now (and it is a veriest throth as the thieves’ re- scension) how it was forstold for me by brevet for my vacation in life while possessing stout legs to be disbarred after holy orders from unnecessary servile work of reckless walking of all sorts for the relics of my time for otherwise by my so douching I would get into a blame there where sieves fall out, Excelsior tips the best. Weak stop work stop walk stop whoak. Go thou this island, one housesleep there, then go thou other island, two housesleep there, then catch one nightmaze, then home to dearies. Never back a woman you defend, never get quit of a friend on whom you depend never make face to a foe till he’s rife and never get stuck to another man’s pfife. Amen; ptah! His hungry will be done! On the continent as in Eironesia. But believe me in my simplicity I am awful good, I believe, so I am, at the root of me, praised be right cheek Discipline! And I can now truthfully declaret before my Geity’s Pantokreator with my fleshfettered palms on the epizzles of the apossels that I do my reasonabler’s best to recite my grocery beans for mummy mit dummy mot muthar mat bonzar regular, genuflections enclosed. Hek domov muy, there thou beest on the hummock, ghee up, ye dog, for your daggily broth, etc., Happy Maria and Glorious Patrick, etc., etc. In fact, always, have I believe. Greedo! Her’s me hongue!
— And it is the fullsoot of a tarabred. Yet one minute’s ob-servation, dear dogmestic Shaun, as we point out how you have while away painted our town a wearing greenridinghued.
— O murder mere, how did you hear? Shaun replied, smoiling the ily way up his lampsleeve (it just seemed the natural thing to do), so shy of light was he then. Well, so be it! The gloom hath rays, her lump is love. And I will confess to have, yes. Your diogneses is anonest man’s. Thrubedore I did! Inditty I did. All lay I did. Down with the Saozon ruze! And I am afraid it wouldn’t be my first coat’s wasting after striding on the vampire and blazing on the focoal. See! blazing on the focoal. As see! blazing upon the foe. Like the regular redshank I am. Impregnable as the mule himself. Somebody may perhaps hint at an aughter impression of was wrong. No such a thing! You never made a more freud-ful mistake, excuse yourself! What’s pork to you means meat to me while you behold how I be eld. But it is grandiose by my ways of thinking from the prophecies. New worlds for all! And they were scotographically arranged for gentlemen only by a scripchewer in whofoundland who finds he is a relative. And it was with my extravert davy. Like glue. Be through. Moyhard’s daynoight, tomthumb. Phwum!
— How mielodorous is thy bel chant, O songbird, and how exqueezit thine after draught! Buccinate in Emenia tuba insigni volumnitatis tuae. But do you mean, O phausdheen phewn, from Pontoffbellek till the Kisslemerched our ledan triz will be? we gathered substantively whether furniture would or verdure var-nish?
— It is a confoundyous injective so to say, Shaun the fiery boy shouted, naturally incensed, as he shook the red pepper out of his auricles. And another time please confine your glaring intinuations to some other mordant body. What on the physiog of this furnaced planet would I be doing besides your verjuice? That is more than I can fix, for the teom bihan, anyway. So let I and you now kindly drop that, angryman! That’s not French pastry. You can take it from me. Understand me when I tell you (and I will ask you not to whisple, cry golden or quoth mecback) that under the past purcell’s office, so deeply deplored by my erstwhile elder friend, Miss Enders, poachmistress and gay re-ceiver ever for in particular to the Scotic Poor Men’s Thousand Gallon Cow Society (I was thinking of her in sthore) allbethey blessed with twentytwo thousand sorters out of a biggest poss of twentytwo thousand, mine’s won, too much privet stationery and safty quipu was ate up larchly by those nettlesome goats out of pension greed. Colpa di Becco, buon apartita! Proceding, I will say it is also one of my avowal’s intentions, at some time pease Pod pluse murthers of gout (when I am not prepared to say) so apt as my pen is upt to scratch, to compound quite the makings of a verdigrease savingsbook in the form of a pair of capri sheep boxing gloves surrounding this matter of the Welsfusel mascoteers and their sindybuck that saved a city for my publickers, Nolaner and Browno, Nickil Hopstout, Christcross, so long as, thanks to force of destiny, my selary as a paykelt is propaired, and there is a peg under me and there is a tum till me.
To the Very Honourable The Memory of Disgrace, the Most Noble, Sometime Sweepyard at the Service of the Writer. Salu-tem dicint. The just defunct Mrs Sanders who (the Loyd insure her!) I was shift and shuft too, with her shester Mrs Shunders, both mudical dauctors from highschoolhorse and aslyke as Easther’s leggs. She was the niceliest person of a wellteached non-party woman that I ever acquired her letters, only too fat, used to babies and tottydean verbish this is her entertermentdags for she shuk the bottle and tuk the medascene all times a day. She was well under ninety, poor late Mrs, and had tastes of the poetics, me having stood the pilgarlick a fresh at sea when the moon also was standing in a corner of sweet Standerson my ski. P.L.M Mevrouw von Andersen was her whogave me a muttonbrooch, stakkers for her begfirst party. Honour thy farmer and my lit-ters. This, my tears, is my last will intesticle wrote off in the strutforit about their absent female assauciations which I, or per-haps any other person what squaton a toffette, have the honour to had upon their polite sophykussens in the real presence of de-vouted Mrs Grumby when her skin was exposed to the air. O what must the grief of my mund be for two little ptpt coolies worth twenty thousand quad herewitdnessed with both’s maddlemass wishes to Pepette for next match from their dearly beloved Roggers, M.D.D. O.D. May doubling drop of drooght! Writing.
— Hopsoloosely kidding you are totether with your cadenus and goat along nose how we shall complete that white paper. Two venusstas! Biggerstiff! Qweer but gaon! Be trouz and wholetrouz! Otherwise, frank Shaun, we pursued, what would be the autobiography of your softbodied fumiform?
— Hooraymost! None whomsoever, Shaun replied, Heavenly blank! (he had intentended and was peering now rather close to the paste of his rubiny winklering) though it ought to be more or less rawcawcaw romantical. By the wag, how is Mr Fry? All of it, I might say, in ex-voto, pay and perks and wooden half- pence, some rhino, rhine, O joyoust rhine, was handled over spon-daneously by me (and bundle end to my illwishers’ Miss Anders! she woor her wraith of ruins the night she lost I left!) in the ligname of Mr van Howten of Tredcastles, Clowntalkin, timbreman, among my prodigits nabobs and navious of every subscription entitled the Bois in the Boscoor, our evicted tenemants. What I say is (and I am noen roehorn or culkilt permit me to tell you, if uninformed), I never spont it. Nor have I the ghuest of innation on me the way to. It is my rule so. It went anyway like hot pottagebake. And this brings me to my fresh point. Quoniam, I am as plain as portable enveloped, inhowmuch, you will now parably receive, care of one of Mooseyeare Goonness’s registered andouterthus barrels. Quick take um whiffat andrainit. Now!
— So vi et! we responded. Song! Shaun, song! Have mood! Hold forth!
— I apologuise, Shaun began, but I would rather spinooze you one from the grimm gests of Jacko and Esaup, fable one, feeble too. Let us here consider the casus, my dear little cousis (husstenhasstencaffincoffintussemtossemdamandamnacosaghcusa-ghhobixhatouxpeswchbechoscashlcarcarcaract) of the Ondt and the Gracehoper.
The Gracehoper was always jigging ajog, hoppy on akkant of his joyicity, (he had a partner pair of findlestilts to supplant him), or, if not, he was always making ungraceful overtures to Floh and Luse and Bienie and Vespatilla to play pupa-pupa and pulicy-pulicy and langtennas and pushpygyddyum and to com-mence insects with him, there mouthparts to his orefice and his gambills to there airy processes, even if only in chaste, ameng the everlistings, behold a waspering pot. He would of curse melissciously, by his fore feelhers, flexors, contractors, depres-sors and extensors, lamely, harry me, marry me, bury me, bind me, till she was puce for shame and allso fourmish her in Spin-ner’s housery at the earthsbest schoppinhour so summery as his cottage, which was cald fourmillierly Tingsomingenting, groped up. Or, if he was always striking up funny funereels with Bester-farther Zeuts, the Aged One, With all his wigeared corollas, albe — dinous and oldbuoyant, inscythe his elytrical wormcasket and Dehlia and Peonia, his druping nymphs, bewheedling him, com-pound eyes on hornitosehead, and Auld Letty Plussiboots to scratch his cacumen and cackle his tramsitus, diva deborah (seven bolls of sapo, a lick of lime, two spurts of fussfor, threefurts of sulph, a shake o’shouker, doze grains of migniss and a mesfull of midcap pitchies. The whool of the whaal in the wheel of the whorl of the Boubou from Bourneum has thus come to taon!), and with tambarins and cantoridettes soturning around his eggs-hill rockcoach their dance McCaper in retrophoebia, beck from bulk, like fantastic disossed and jenny aprils, to the ra, the ra, the ra, the ra, langsome heels and langsome toesis, attended to by a mutter and doffer duffmatt baxingmotch and a myrmidins of pszozlers pszinging Satyr’s Caudledayed Nice and Hombly, Dombly Sod We Awhile but Ho, Time Timeagen, Wake! For if sciencium (what’s what) can mute uns nought, ‘a thought, abought the Great Sommboddy within the Omniboss, perhops an artsaccord (hoot’s hoot) might sing ums tumtim abutt the Little Newbuddies that ring his panch. A high old tide for the bar-heated publics and the whole day as gratiis! Fudder and lighting for ally looty, any filly in a fog, for O’Cronione lags acrumbling in his sands but his sunsunsuns still tumble on. Erething above ground, as his Book of Breathings bed him, so as everwhy, sham or shunner, zeemliangly to kick time.
Grouscious me and scarab my sahull What a bagateller it is! Libelulous! Inzanzarity! Pou! Pschla! Ptuh! What a zeit for the goths! vented the Ondt, who, not being a sommerfool, was thothfolly making chilly spaces at hisphex affront of the icinglass of his windhame, which was cold antitopically Nixnixundnix. We shall not come to party at that lopp’s, he decided possibly, for he is not on our social list. Nor to Ba’s berial nether, thon sloghard, this oldeborre’s yaar ablong as there’s a khul on a khat. Nefersenless, when he had safely looked up his ovipository, he loftet hails and prayed: May he me no voida water! Seekit Ha-tup! May no he me tile pig shed on! Suckit Hotup! As broad as Beppy’s realm shall flourish my reign shall flourish! As high as Heppy’s hevn shall flurrish my haine shall hurrish! Shall grow, shall flourish! Shall hurrish! Hummum.
The Ondt was a weltall fellow, raumybult and abelboobied, bynear saw altitudinous wee a schelling in kopfers. He was sair sair sullemn and chairmanlooking when he was not making spaces in his psyche, but, laus! when he wore making spaces on his ikey, he ware mouche mothst secred and muravyingly wisechairman-looking. Now whim the sillybilly of a Gracehoper had jingled through a jungle of love and debts and jangled through a jumble of life in doubts afterworse, wetting with the bimblebeaks, drik-king with nautonects, bilking with durrydunglecks and horing after ladybirdies (ichnehmon diagelegenaitoikon) he fell joust as sieck as a sexton and tantoo pooveroo quant a churchprince, and wheer the midges to wend hemsylph or vosch to sirch for grub for his corapusse or to find a hospes, alick, he wist gnit! Bruko dry! fuko spint! Sultamont osa bare! And volomundo osi vide-vide! Nichtsnichtsundnichts! Not one pickopeck of muscow — money to bag a tittlebits of beebread! Iomio! Iomio! Crick’s corbicule, which a plight! O moy Bog, he contrited with melan-ctholy. Meblizzered, him sluggered! I am heartily hungry!
He had eaten all the whilepaper, swallowed the lustres, de-voured forty flights of styearcases, chewed up all the mensas and seccles, ronged the records, made mundballs of the ephemerids and vorasioused most glutinously with the very timeplace in the ternitary — not too dusty a cicada of neutriment for a chittinous chip so mitey. But when Chrysalmas was on the bare branches, off he went from Tingsomingenting. He took a round stroll and he took a stroll round and he took a round strollagain till the grillies in his head and the leivnits in his hair made him thought he had the Tossmania. Had he twicycled the sees of the deed and trestraversed their revermer? Was he come to hevre with his engiles or gone to hull with the poop? The June snows was flocking in thuckflues on the hegelstomes, millipeeds of it and myriopoods, and a lugly whizzling tournedos, the Boraborayel-]ers, blohablasting tegolhuts up to tetties and ruching sleets off the coppeehouses, playing ragnowrock rignewreck, with an irri- tant, penetrant, siphonopterous spuk. Grausssssss! Opr! Grausssssss! Opr!
The Gracehoper who, though blind as batflea, yet knew, not a leetle beetle, his good smetterling of entymology asped niss-unitimost lous nor liceens but promptly tossed himself in the vico, phthin and phthir, on top of his buzzer, tezzily wondering wheer would his aluck alight or boss of both appease and the next time he makes the aquinatance of the Ondt after this they have met themselves, these mouschical umsummables, it shall be motylucky if he will beheld not a world of differents. Behailed His Gross the Ondt, prostrandvorous upon his dhrone, in his Papylonian babooshkees, smolking a spatial brunt of Hosana cigals, with unshrinkables farfalling from his unthinkables, swarming of himself in his sunnyroom, sated before his com-fortumble phullupsuppy of a plate o’monkynous and a confucion of minthe (for he was a conformed aceticist and aristotaller), as appi as a oneysucker or a baskerboy on the Libido, with Floh biting his leg thigh and Luse lugging his luff leg and Bieni bussing him under his bonnet and Vespatilla blowing cosy fond tutties up the allabroad length of the large of his smalls. As entomate as intimate could pinchably be. Emmet and demmet and be jiltses crazed and be jadeses whipt! schneezed the Gracehoper, aguepe with ptchjelasys and at his wittol’s indts, what have eyeforsight!
The Ondt, that true and perfect host, a spiter aspinne, was making the greatest spass a body could with his queens lace-swinging for he was spizzing all over him like thingsumanything in formicolation, boundlessly blissfilled in an allallahbath of houris. He was ameising himself hugely at crabround and mary-pose, chasing Floh out of charity and tickling Luse, I hope too, and tackling Bienie, faith, as well, and jucking Vespatilla jukely by the chimiche. Never did Dorsan from Dunshanagan dance it with more devilry! The veripatetic imago of the impossible Gracehoper on his odderkop in the myre, after his thrice ephe-meral journeeys, sans mantis ne shooshooe, featherweighed animule, actually and presumptuably sinctifying chronic’s de-spair, was sufficiently and probably coocoo much for his chorous of gravitates. Let him be Artalone the Weeps with his parisites peeling off him I’ll be Highfee the Crackasider. Flunkey Footle furloughed foul, writing off his phoney, but Conte Carme makes the melody that mints the money. Ad majorem l.s.d.! Divi gloriam. A darkener of the threshold. Haru? Orimis, capsizer of his ant-boat, sekketh rede from Evil-it-is, lord of loaves in Amongded. Be it! So be it! Thou-who-thou-art, the fleet-as-spindhrift, impfang thee of mine wideheight. Haru!
The thing pleased him andt, and andt, He larved ond he larved on he merd such a nauses The Gracehoper feared he would mixplace his fauces. I forgive you, grondt Ondt, said the Gracehoper, weeping, For their sukes of the sakes you are safe in whose keeping. Teach Floh and Luse polkas, show Bienie where’s sweet And be sure Vespatilla fines fat ones to heat. As I once played the piper I must now pay the count So saida to Moyhammlet and marhaba to your Mount! Let who likes lump above so what flies be a full ’un; I could not feel moregruggy if this was prompollen. I pick up your reproof, the horsegift of a friend, For the prize of your save is the price of my spend. Can castwhores pulladeftkiss if oldpollocks forsake ’em Or Culex feel etchy if Pulex don’t wake him? A locus to loue, a term it t’embarass, These twain are the twins that tick Homo Vulgaris. Has Aquileone nort winged to go syf Since the Gwyfyn we were in his farrest drewbryf And that Accident Man not beseeked where his story ends Since longsephyring sighs sought heartseast for their orience? We are Wastenot with Want, precondamned, two and true, Till Nolans go volants and Bruneyes come blue. Ere those gidflirts now gadding you quit your mocks for my gropes An extense must impull, an elapse must elopes, Of my tectucs takestock, tinktact, and ail’s weal; As I view by your farlook hale yourself to my heal. Partiprise my thinwhins whiles my blink points unbroken on Your whole’s whercabroads with Tout’s trightyright token on. My in risible universe youdly haud find Sulch oxtrabeeforeness meat soveal behind. Your feats end enormous, your volumes immense, (May the Graces I hoped for sing your Ondtship song sense!), Your genus its worldwide, your spacest sublime! But, Holy Saltmartin, why can’t you beat time?
In the name of the former and of the latter and of their holo-caust. Allmen.
— Now? How good you are in explosition! How farflung is your fokloire and how velktingeling your volupkabulary! Qui vive sparanto qua muore contanto. O foibler, O flip, you’ve that wandervogl wail withyin! It falls easily upon the earopen and goes down the friskly shortiest like treacling tumtim with its tingting-taggle. The blarneyest blather in all Corneywall! But could you, of course, decent Lettrechaun, we knew (to change your name of not your nation) while still in the barrel, read the strangewrote anaglyptics of those shemletters patent for His Christian’s Em?
— Greek! Hand it to me! Shaun replied, plosively pointing to the cinnamon quistoquill behind his acoustrolobe. I’m as after-dusk nobly Roman as pope and water could christen me. Look at that for a ridingpin! I am, thing Sing Larynx, letter potent to play the sem backwards like Oscan wild or in shunt Persse trans-luding from the Otherman or off the Toptic or anything off the types of my finklers in the draught or with buttles, with my oyes thickshut and all. But, hellas, it is harrobrew bad on the corns and callouses. As far as that goes I associate myself with your remark just now from theodicy re’furloined notepaper and quite agree in your prescriptions for indeed I am, pay Gay, in juxtaposition to say it is not a nice production. It is a pinch of scribble, not wortha bottle of cabbis. Overdrawn! Puffedly offal tosh! Be-sides its auctionable, all about crime and libel! Nothing beyond clerical horrors et omnibus‘ to be entered for the foreign as second-class matter. The fuellest filth ever fired since Charley Lucan’s. Flummery is what I would call it if you were to ask me to put it on a single dimension what pronounced opinion I might possibly orally have about them bagses of trash which the mother and Mr Unmentionable (O breed not his same!) has reduced to writing without making news out of my sootynemm. When she slipped under her couchman. And where he made a cat with a peep. How they wore two madges on the makewater. And why there were treefellers in the shrubrubs. Then he hawks his hand-mud figgers from Francie to Fritzie down in the kookin. Phiz is me mother and Hair’s me father. Bauv Betty Famm and Pig Pig Pike. Their livetree (may it flourish!) by their ecotaph (let it stayne!). With balsinbal bimbies swarming tiltop. Comme bien, Comme bien! Feefeel! Feefeel! And the Dutches dyin loffin at his pon peck de Barec. And all the mound reared. Till he wot not wot to begin he should. An infant sailing eggshells on the floor of a wet day would have more sabby.

— Kind Shaun, we all requested, much as we hate to say it, but since you rose to the use of money have you not, without suggesting for an instant, millions of moods used up slanguage tun times as words as the penmarks used out in sinscript with such hesitancy by your cerebrated brother — excuse me not men-tioningahem?
— CelebrAted! Shaun replied under the sheltar of his brog-uish, vigorously rubbing his magic lantern to a glow of full — consciousness. HeCitEncy! Your words grates on my ares. Notorious I rather would feel inclined to myself in the first place to describe Mr O’Shem the Draper with before letter as should I be accentually called upon for a dieoguinnsis to pass my opinions, properly spewing, into impulsory irelitz. But I would not care to be so unfruitful to my own part as to swear for the moment posi-tively as to the views of Denmark. No, sah! But let me say my every belief before my high Gee is that I much doubt of it. I’ve no room for that fellow on my fagroaster, I just can’t. As I hourly learn from Rooters and Havers through Gilligan’s maypoles in a nice pathetic notice he, the pixillated doodler, is on his last with illegible clergimanths boasting always of his ruddy complexious! She, the mammy far, was put up to it by him, the iniquity that ought to be depraved of his libertins to be silenced, sackclothed and suspended, and placed in irons into some drapyery institution off the antipopees for wordsharping only if he was klanver enough to pass the panel fleischcurers and the fieldpost censor. Gach! For that is a fullblown fact and well celibated before the four divorce courts and all the King’s paunches, how he has the solitary from seeing Scotch snakes and has a lowsense for the pro-duction of consumption and dalickey cyphalos on his brach premises where he can purge his contempt and dejeunerate into a skillyton be thinking himself to death. Rot him! Flannelfeet! Flatty-ro! I will describe you in a word. Thou. (I beg your pardon.) Homo! Then putting his bedfellow on me! (like into mike and nick onto post). The criniman: I’ll give it to him for that! Making the lobbard change hisstops, as we say in the long book! Is he on whosekeeping or are my! Obnoximost posthumust! With his unique hornbook and his prince of the apauper’s pride, blundering all over the two worlds! If he waits till I buy him a mossel — man’s present! Ho’s nos halfcousin of mine, pigdish! Nor wants to! I’d famish with the cuistha first. Aham!
— May we petition you, Shaun illustrious, then, to put his prentis’ pride in your aproper’s purse and to unravel in your own sweet way with words of style to your very and most obse-quient, we suggested, with yet an esiop’s foible, as to how?
— Well it is partly my own, isn’t it? and you may, ought and welcome, Shaun replied, taking at the same time, as his hunger got the bitter of him, a hearty bite out of the honeycomb of his Braham and Melosedible hat, tryone, tryon and triune. Ann wun-kum. Sure, I thunkum you knew all about that, honorey causes, through thelemontary channels long agum. Sure, that is as old as the Baden bees of Saint Dominoc’s and as commonpleas now to allus pueblows and bunkum as Nelson his trifulgurayous pillar. However. Let me see, do. Beerman’s bluff was what begun it, Old Knoll and his borrowing! And then the liliens of the veldt, Nancy Nickies and Folletta Lajambe! Then mem and hem and the jaque-jack. All about Wucherer and righting his name for him. I regret to announce, after laying out his litterery bed, for two days she kept squealing down for noisy priors and bawling out to her jameymock farceson in Shemish like a mouther of the incas with a garcielasso huw Ananymus pinched her tights and about the Balt with the markshaire parawag and his loyal divorces, when he feraxiously shed ovas in Alemaney, tse tse, all the tell of the tud with the bourighevisien backclack, and him, the cribibber like an ambitrickster, aspiring like the decan’s, fast aslooped in the intrance to his polthronechair with his sixth finger between his cats — eye and the index, making his pillgrimace of Childe Horrid, en — grossing to his ganderpan what the idioglossary he invented under hicks hyssop! Hock! Ickick gav him that toock, imitator! And it was entirely theck latter to blame. Does he drink because I am sorely there shall be no more Kates and Nells. If you see him it took place there. It was given meeck, thank the Bench, to assist at the whole thing byck special chancery licence. As often as I think of that unbloody housewarmer, Shem Skrivenitch, always cutting my prhose to please his phrase, bogorror, I declare I get the jawache! Be me punting his reflection he’d begin his beogre-fright in muddyass ribalds. Digteter! Grundtsagar! Swop beef! You know he’s peculiar, that eggschicker, with the smell of old woman off him, to suck nothing of his switchedupes. M.D. made his ante mortem for him. He was grey at three, like sygnus the swan, when he made his boo to the public and barnacled up to the eyes when he repented after seven. The alum that winters on his top is the stale of the staun that will soar when he stambles till that hag of the coombe rapes the pad off his lock. He was down with the whooping laugh at the age of the loss of reason the whopping first time he prediseased me. He’s weird, I tell you, and middayevil down to his vegetable soul. Never mind his falls feet and his tanbark complexion. That’s why he was forbidden tomate and was warmed off the ricecourse of marrimoney, under the Helpless Corpses Enactment. I’m not at all surprised the saint kicked him whereby the sum taken Berkeley showed the reason genrously. Negas, negasti — negertop, negertoe, negertoby, ne-grunter! Then he was pusched out of Thingamuddy’s school by Miss Garterd, for itching. Then he caught the europicolas and went into the society of jewses. With Bro Cahlls and Fran Czeschs and Bruda Pszths and Brat Slavos. One temp when he foiled to be killed, the freak wanted to put his bilingual head intentionally through the Ikish Tames and go and join the clericy as a demoni-can skyterrier. Throwing dust in the eyes of the Hooley Fer — mers! He used to be avowdeed as he ought to be vitandist. For onced I squeaked by twyst I’ll squelch him. Then he went to Cecilia’s treat on his solo to pick up Galen. Asbestopoulos! Inku-pot! He has encaust in the blood. Shim! I have the outmost con tempt for. Prost bitten! Conshy! Tiberia is waiting on you, arestocrank! Chaka a seagull ticket at Gattabuia and Gabbiano’s! Go o’er the sea, haythen, from me and leave your libber to TCD. Your puddin is cooked! You’re served, cram ye! Fatefully yaourth . . . Ex. Ex. Ex. Ex.
— But for what, thrice truthful teller, Shaun of grace? weakly we went on to ask now of the gracious one. Vouchsafe to say. You will now, goodness, won’t you? Why?
— For his root language, if you ask me whys, Shaun replied, as he blessed himself devotionally like a crawsbomb, making act of oblivion, footinmouther! (what the thickuns else?) which he picksticked into his lettruce invrention. Ullhodturdenweirmud-gaardgringnirurdrmolnirfenrirlukkilokkibaugimandodrrerin — surtkrinmgernrackinarockar! Thor’s for yo!
— The hundredlettered name again, last word of perfect lan-guage. But you could come near it, we do suppose, strong Shaun 0’, we foresupposed. How?
— Peax! Peax! Shaun replied in vealar penultimatum. ’Tis pebils before Sweeney’s as he swigged a slug of Jon Jacobsen from his treestem sucker cane. Mildbut likesome! I might as well be talking to the four waves till tibbes grey eves and the rests asleep. Frost! Nope! No one in his seven senses could as I have before said, only you missed my drift, for it’s being incendiary. Every dimmed letter in it is a copy and not a few of the silbils and wholly words I can show you in my Kingdom of Heaven. The lowquacity of him! With his threestar monothong! Thaw! The last word in stolentelling! And what’s more right-down lowbrown schisthematic robblemint! Yes. As he was rising my lather. Like you. And as I was plucking his goosybone. Like yea. He store the tale of me shur. Like yup. How’s that for Shemese?
— Still in a way, not to flatter you, we fancy you that you are so strikingly brainy and well letterread in yourshelves as ever were the Shamous Shamonous, Limited, could use worse of yourself, ingenious Shaun, we still so fancied, if only you would take your time so and the trouble of so doing it. Upu now!
— Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, the mutter-melk of his blood donor beginning to work, and while innocent of disseminating the foul emanation, it would be a fall day I could not, sole, so you can keep your space and by the power of blurry wards I am loyable to do it (I am convicted of it!) any time ever I liked (bet ye fippence off me boot allowance!) with the allergrossest transfusiasm as, you see, while I can soroquise the Siamanish better than most, it is an openear secret, be it said, how I am extremely ingenuous at the clerking even with my badily left and, arrah go braz, I’d pinsel it with immenuensoes as easy as I’d perorate a chickerow of beans for the price of two maricles and my trifolium librotto, the authordux Book of Lief, would, if given to daylight, (I hold a most incredible faith about it) far exceed what that bogus bolshy of a shame, my soamheis brother, Gaoy Fecks, is conversant with in audible black and prink. Outragedy of poetscalds! Acomedy of letters! I have them all, tame, deep and harried, in my mine’s I. And one of these fine days, man dear, when the mood is on me, that I may willhap cut my throat with my tongue tonight but I will be ormuzd moved to take potlood and introvent it Paatryk just like a work of merit, mark my words and append to my mark twang, that will open your pucktricker’s ops for you, broather brooher, only for, as a papst and an immature and a nayophight and a spaciaman spaciosum and a hundred and eleven other things, I would never for anything take so much trouble of such doing. And why so? Because I am altogether a chap too fly and hairyman for to infradig the like of that ultravirulence. And by all I hold sacred on earth clouds and in heaven I swear to you on my piop and oath by the awe of Shaun (and that’s a howl of a name!) that I will commission to the flames any incendiarist whosoever or ahriman howsoclever who would endeavour to set ever annyma roner moother of mine on fire. Rock me julie but I will soho!
And, with that crickcrackcruck of his threelungged squool from which grief had usupped every smile, big hottempered husky fusky krenfy strenfy pugiliser, such as he was, he virtually broke down on the mooherhead, getting quite jerry over her, overpowered by himself with the love of the tearsilver that he twined through her hair for, sure, he was the soft semplgawn slob of the world with a heart like Montgomery’s in his showchest and harvey loads of feeling in him and as innocent and undesign-ful as the freshfallen calef. Still, grossly unselfish in sickself, he dished allarmes away and laughed it off with a wipe at his pud-gies and a gulp apologetic, healing his tare be the smeyle of his oye, oogling around. Him belly no belong sollow mole pigeon. Ally bully. Fu Li’s gulpa. Mind you, now, that he was in the dumpest of earnest orthough him jawr war hoo hleepy hor halk urthing hurther. Moe like that only he stopped short in looking up up upfrom his tide shackled wrists through the ghost of an ocean’s, the wieds of pansiful heathvens of joepeter’s gaseytotum as they are telling not but were and will be, all told, scruting fore-back into the fargoneahead to feel out what age in years tropical, ecclesiastic, civil or sidereal he might find by the sirious pointstand of Charley’s Wain (what betune the spheres sledding along the lacteal and the mansions of the blest turning on old times) as ere-while had he craved of thus, the dreamskhwindel necklassoed him, his thumbs fell into his fists and, lusosing the harmonical balance of his ballbearing extremities, by the holy kettle, like a flask of lightning over he careened (O the sons of the fathers!) by the mightyfine weight of his barrel (all that prevented the happering of who if not the asterisks betwink themselves shall ever?) and, as the wisest postlude course he could playact, collaspsed in en-semble and rolled buoyantly backwards in less than a twink — ling via Rattigan’s corner out of farther earshot with his highly curious mode of slipashod motion, surefoot, sorefoot, slickfoot, slackfoot, linkman laizurely, lampman loungey, and by Killesther’s lapes and falls, with corks, staves and treeleaves and more bub-bles to his keelrow a fairish and easy way enough as the town cow cries behind the times in the direction of Mac Auliffe’s, the crucet-house, Open the Door Softly, down in the valley before he was really uprighted ere in a dip of the downs (uila!) he spoorlessly disappaled and vanesshed, like a popo down a papa, from circular circulatio. Ah, mean!

Ghostbusters,Bonez Jonez and the Black Cats,"1 ContributorRone & Real Deal vs. Troy Brown & Roosevelt Lyrics
What the fuck would you really do if I punched you in the face?
Exactly what I thought
He'd turn Revis, Jet to the corner and this fag would flag a cop
Now Troy George loves a rosey so he'd try to fight for you
All your life Troy people been telling you that's mighty white of you

Yo, fuck your gun talk
Say what you would really do if you got all irate
Unfollow on Twitter, defriend on Myspace
Unstable, leaving the lunch table like ""We weren't friends in the first place""
Yelling over the bathroom stall, ""You're uninvited from my birthday.""

I bet you and your homie spend Baltimore winters nights
Around a barrel of fire
Singing songs and harmonizing like they're in a choir
Soften his feet with a little bit of change in a coffee tin
Rubbing two mittens together, cigarette dangling off his chin

I ah, I played all your battles for some Caucasians one night
Put 'em on, then said, ""Just listen"" then played them all twice
They said he came across light, he can't at all fight
Grammar game is all tight, he uses big words and he say 'em all right
""Y'all can look now"" ""No way! He's not white!""
You might also like
I had absolutely no idea how to write for you
Just to make myself clear
Then I took a look at them shits, I was like, ""Psst, Fuck it Troy we'll play this by ear""
Yo, and when you're not giving fallatio
You stay at home and remember the time you embarrassed yourself on TV like, ""Don't tase me bro!""

Yo, I get a lot of comparisons to Rone
Difference is, you're barely skin and bones
And like wearing women's clothes
I'm a Maryland terrapin, you're a Marilyn Monroe
Ayo, if I catch you on that bench I'll take your gems and your necklace next
Cause you're from that city of that dumb bell but you ain't fit to rep your set

Yo, you have the key to his chastity belt
And you look like the Nestee snowman after he melts
Yo, you fucking regular Joe, I bet your family's nice and fit
I bet you have a wife and kids and pay taxes, like a BITCH
Yo, you got the face of a country singer
And when you're sporting those puppy t-shirts
You look like a 40 year old Justin Bieber
If he was casted for a supporting role in Jungle Fever
You studied theater, you've been an actor since day one
Y'all conduct some research, you're not your brother's keeper
You switched up on ZM faster than Chang Sun
I guess Adam's been spent so much time talking to snakes he actually became one
You ain't moving state to state with fresh coke, keeping keys in the car
You're moving state to state cause Fresco keeps keying your car
You got no punches and a voice fit for female genitalia
If everyone from your town had your sound
They'd have to change the name to Filler-delphia
And if you're the original man, then it actually seems odd
Ruff Ryders chose the girl from Philly to add to the team dawg
I guess they're still waiting on Adam to Eve-olove
You're about as tough as an Avril Lavine song, you ain't really a threat
Yo, you raise your voice and blow hot air
I'll squeeze a balloon to there's no helium left
You better play your cards right
Cause I'll make a solid pair and peel through your flesh
Cause if you force me to fold my hand, Deal will get decked

Lipton Iced Tea and ear jokes, that's some irrelevant shit
I'm a rap star, your mother calls me Bad Bar I give her elephant dick

Yo, you call me a theater major to try to see my reaction
But I'll make you look like a beat faggot without theatrics
And I won't be acting
Yo, like Cannon, I also don't believe you would a Mag', shit
You probably have an awesome dad, who's cars a van
Who carts his ass to kickboxing classes and hockey practice
I can do it too, you're just talking fast bitch
That speedy speech won't help you sell it's not an auction faggot!
You got a face just like a grandpa
I bet you're the 17 year old hooker that got caught giving Lawrence Taylor a hand job
Wait a minute, I remember you at Bad Blood
You was cuddling and kissing that large hoe
Telling everyone she was a star cause she looked like a before picture of Star Jones

And if you haven't seen his girl, it should really tell you something
That her nipples are on the same line as her belly button
And I know you say that ""pussy is pussy"" but that mantra is hazardous
Because pussy is not pussy if that pussy has a dick

Why you get all pissed off lyrically
If you're just soft physically?
You gassed up cause you and Farum has the greatest battle in Kidz Bop history
Don King, Don Trump, I mean all of the dons are feeling us
And who the fuck are you? Hallow the Don Cornelius?
You! You are a coke fiend Troy and that's your primary focus
You know how I know? Every time Roosevelt's voice cracks, you try to smoke it

You battled A-Class and weren't prepared to do your rap
So you through up your hoodie and did your best Larry Hoover act
They say karma comes around, that's rarely true but Class
Finally got to cut Ferris Bueller back

Well fuck that yo, that battle as a whole was amazing
That was the first time I'd seen a bitch choke on an Asian
Yo, we spit with ProTools cause our craft is better
This hick has pro tools, Black And Decker

When I think ""old school"" I think Run-DMC with the patent leather
When you think ""old school"" you think ""last semester""
Damn it Trevor, you can't borrow any of my black panther sweaters

Rone, you read? Stop being a faggot, buy an X-Box and get your act together
And since you're an English teacher when I perform my rapping lecture
Pull up Microsoft Word and fucking correct my grammar error

We only invited you nerds here because we support integration
But now they wanna hear a Brown verse cause they're bored of education
But this ain't the apocalypse of racial intolerance
I can swell up your lips
That's just what he wants, a face full of collegian
So I won't react with the force of 80 Somalians
Cause even if I remove Adam's rib, I couldn't take the BITCH out of him

Yo, the only time that he will com-bat with a strike
Is when his teaching contract isn't right

Ayo, and you beat Charles Hamilton nice
So why's he in the music game pursing fame with song fans and the liking
And you're into music games cause you just play Garage Band every night

Real Deal is in a position that Rone doesn't have
So it's ironic that he's the teacher and you're holding him back

I'll hit 'em BOTH with a smack
I don't even have to deploy the clips at 'em
Y'all said my past battle history so you won't shoot back
Though I can avoid the Big Kannon

Heavy handed upper cuts
Joints and limbs snapping

Making shoulders shake and pop

It look like Poison Pen laughing

Why you trying to perp like you're straight and your bars are sick?
You on stage with a hundred dudes and your nipples are hard as shit
You talk that whole time back and forth, you gon' stomp me, not
This is a mismatch just like blonkie's socks
Ayo, check it
You saying you don't sound like Condoleezza Rice
Is like me saying every player on Ghana's soccer team is white
I mean, why do you spit like you're so gutter
When you look like Winston from Ghostbusters
Y'all might not believe it, but I saw a picture of this old buster
It was a family photo, that was taken back at Princeton with 

Check me, yo, if you're not getting bullied, you probably should be
I be talking to you through the locker like, ""PUSSY!
You do my homework 'til you get a growth spurt.""
Then spit in your sloppy joe and poop in your yogurt

He said something about teaching
If you was in my class, the name tag would read ""Hoe"" on your desk
Every day that you'd dress as a dude I'd write you up for inappropriate dress
I'd give extra credit to every bully that steals a pair of sneakers off him
And you could watch me skull fuck your mother at every parent teacher conference

Yo, look, a bi-racial team in a world of segregation
Brown couldn't beat us, you're right, but at least you beat the Board Of Education
And if you're religious, that's delicious
I hope you sleep with rosaries
I'll lay a rose for Rose where Roose sleeps and choke his themes with rosey dreams
Troy's trash, Teddy's ass yes indeed! Rosey's cheeks
Deserves the high five from me and I'm leaving rosey cheeks

Just cause you talk loud, don't act like that boy hype
Over there looking like Troy White

Rosey hates you, cause you let Caustic escape from out his bird cage
Your son hates you cause he still has to go to school on Take Your Child To Work Day

So I'll walk upon your land just to see how your farms doing
And the second you turn around BOOW! sheep in a sharp shooter
Fuck it, you're past lame, you better start running on that way
You do impressions can you can't leave one in the rap game

You battle with cats who get paid to rap but made no cash for yourself yet
But with that sloppy grammar, I bet you can't even spell ""check""
You're broke!
And I heard your ex-wife snorts coke
Sorta like Scarface

So we made her suck our dick for crack
She was stuck between a rock and a hard place
Stupid tramp

Scooped her fast

Took her faith

Scooby Snacks

Got her wet

Hoover Dam

He walked in

""WHO IS THAT?!""

You're creative?
You try to be gay that's why when you rap YMCA
I don't care if you're finding it strange
I'll lock you inside of a cage with nine different apes like ""Try and escape""
No, no, you dropped ZM...for him?!
You don't give a fuck how your friend's feel?
Or you had to find a new partner because he thought you were garbage
Get Real!

I don't give a fuck
Yo, I'll hit him up
Interrupt your beer cade game like
Dixie cup
Lift it up
When he looks

Kick the nuts
Stop calling me a wigger
I'm not on that wigger stuff
I ain't playing 'round, I'll fuck y'all

Infinity Beats,HECTOR FLORENTINO,"3 ContributorsChilde Harold’s Pilgrimage (Canto 2) LyricsCanto the Second
I.
Come, blue-eyed maid of heaven!—but thou, alas,
Didst never yet one mortal song inspire—
Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,
And is, despite of war and wasting fire,
And years, that bade thy worship to expire:
But worse than steel, and flame, and ages slow,
Is the drear sceptre and dominion dire
Of men who never felt the sacred glow
That thoughts of thee and thine on polished breasts bestow.
II.
Ancient of days! august Athena! where,
Where are thy men of might, thy grand in soul?
Gone—glimmering through the dream of things that were:
First in the race that led to Glory's goal,
They won, and passed away—is this the whole?
A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour!
The warrior's weapon and the sophist's stole
Are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower,
Dim with the mist of years, grey flits the shade of power.
III.
Son of the morning, rise! approach you here!
Come—but molest not yon defenceless urn!
Look on this spot—a nation's sepulchre!
Abode of gods, whose shrines no longer burn.
E'en gods must yield—religions take their turn:
'Twas Jove's—'tis Mahomet's; and other creeds
Will rise with other years, till man shall learn
Vainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds;
Poor child of Doubt and Death, whose hope is built on reeds.
IV.
Bound to the earth, he lifts his eyes to heaven—
Is't not enough, unhappy thing, to know
Thou art?  Is this a boon so kindly given,
That being, thou wouldst be again, and go,
Thou know'st not, reck'st not to what region, so
On earth no more, but mingled with the skies!
Still wilt thou dream on future joy and woe?
Regard and weigh yon dust before it flies:
That little urn saith more than thousand homilies.
V.
Or burst the vanished hero's lofty mound;
Far on the solitary shore he sleeps;
He fell, and falling nations mourned around;
But now not one of saddening thousands weeps,
Nor warlike worshipper his vigil keeps
Where demi-gods appeared, as records tell.
Remove yon skull from out the scattered heaps:
Is that a temple where a God may dwell?
Why, e'en the worm at last disdains her shattered cell!
VI.
Look on its broken arch, its ruined wall,
Its chambers desolate, and portals foul:
Yes, this was once Ambition's airy hall,
The dome of Thought, the Palace of the Soul.
Behold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,
The gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit,
And Passion's host, that never brooked control:
Can all saint, sage, or sophist ever writ,
People this lonely tower, this tenement refit?
VII.
Well didst thou speak, Athena's wisest son!
'All that we know is, nothing can be known.'
Why should we shrink from what we cannot shun?
Each hath its pang, but feeble sufferers groan
With brain-born dreams of evil all their own.
Pursue what chance or fate proclaimeth best;
Peace waits us on the shores of Acheron:
There no forced banquet claims the sated guest,
But Silence spreads the couch of ever welcome rest.
VIII.
Yet if, as holiest men have deemed, there be
A land of souls beyond that sable shore,
To shame the doctrine of the Sadducee
And sophists, madly vain of dubious lore;
How sweet it were in concert to adore
With those who made our mortal labours light!
To hear each voice we feared to hear no more!
Behold each mighty shade revealed to sight,
The Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the right!
IX.
There, thou!—whose love and life together fled,
Have left me here to love and live in vain—
Twined with my heart, and can I deem thee dead,
When busy memory flashes on my brain?
Well—I will dream that we may meet again,
And woo the vision to my vacant breast:
If aught of young Remembrance then remain,
Be as it may Futurity's behest,
For me 'twere bliss enough to know thy spirit blest!
X.
Here let me sit upon this mossy stone,
The marble column's yet unshaken base!
Here, son of Saturn, was thy favourite throne!
Mightiest of many such!  Hence let me trace
The latent grandeur of thy dwelling-place.
It may not be:  nor even can Fancy's eye
Restore what time hath laboured to deface.
Yet these proud pillars claim no passing sigh;
Unmoved the Moslem sits, the light Greek carols by.
XI.
But who, of all the plunderers of yon fane
On high, where Pallas lingered, loth to flee
The latest relic of her ancient reign—
The last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?
Blush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!
England!  I joy no child he was of thine:
Thy free-born men should spare what once was free;
Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,
And bear these altars o'er the long reluctant brine.
XII.
But most the modern Pict's ignoble boast,
To rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared:
Cold as the crags upon his native coast,
His mind as barren and his heart as hard,
Is he whose head conceived, whose hand prepared,
Aught to displace Athena's poor remains:
Her sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard,
Yet felt some portion of their mother's pains,
And never knew, till then, the weight of Despot's chains.
XIII.
What! shall it e'er be said by British tongue
Albion was happy in Athena's tears?
Though in thy name the slaves her bosom wrung,
Tell not the deed to blushing Europe's ears;
The ocean queen, the free Britannia, bears
The last poor plunder from a bleeding land:
Yes, she, whose generous aid her name endears,
Tore down those remnants with a harpy's hand.
Which envious eld forbore, and tyrants left to stand.
XIV.
Where was thine aegis, Pallas, that appalled
Stern Alaric and Havoc on their way?
Where Peleus' son? whom Hell in vain enthralled,
His shade from Hades upon that dread day
Bursting to light in terrible array!
What! could not Pluto spare the chief once more,
To scare a second robber from his prey?
Idly he wandered on the Stygian shore,
Nor now preserved the walls he loved to shield before.
XV.
Cold is the heart, fair Greece, that looks on thee,
Nor feels as lovers o'er the dust they loved;
Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
By British hands, which it had best behoved
To guard those relics ne'er to be restored.
Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
And snatched thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!
XVI.
But where is Harold? shall I then forget
To urge the gloomy wanderer o'er the wave?
Little recked he of all that men regret;
No loved one now in feigned lament could rave;
No friend the parting hand extended gave,
Ere the cold stranger passed to other climes.
Hard is his heart whom charms may not enslave;
But Harold felt not as in other times,
And left without a sigh the land of war and crimes.
XVII.
He that has sailed upon the dark blue sea,
Has viewed at times, I ween, a full fair sight;
When the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be,
The white sails set, the gallant frigate tight,
Masts, spires, and strand retiring to the right,
The glorious main expanding o'er the bow,
The convoy spread like wild swans in their flight,
The dullest sailer wearing bravely now,
So gaily curl the waves before each dashing prow.
XVIII.
And oh, the little warlike world within!
The well-reeved guns, the netted canopy,
The hoarse command, the busy humming din,
When, at a word, the tops are manned on high:
Hark to the boatswain's call, the cheering cry,
While through the seaman's hand the tackle glides
Or schoolboy midshipman that, standing by,
Strains his shrill pipe, as good or ill betides,
And well the docile crew that skilful urchin guides.
XIX.
White is the glassy deck, without a stain,
Where on the watch the staid lieutenant walks:
Look on that part which sacred doth remain
For the lone chieftain, who majestic stalks,
Silent and feared by all:  not oft he talks
With aught beneath him, if he would preserve
That strict restraint, which broken, ever baulks
Conquest and Fame:  but Britons rarely swerve
From law, however stern, which tends their strength to nerve.
XX.
Blow, swiftly blow, thou keel-compelling gale,
Till the broad sun withdraws his lessening ray;
Then must the pennant-bearer slacken sail,
That lagging barks may make their lazy way.
Ah! grievance sore, and listless dull delay,
To waste on sluggish hulks the sweetest breeze!
What leagues are lost before the dawn of day,
Thus loitering pensive on the willing seas,
The flapping sails hauled down to halt for logs like these!
XXI.
The moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve!
Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand!
Now lads on shore may sigh, and maids believe:
Such be our fate when we return to land!
Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand
Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love:
A circle there of merry listeners stand,
Or to some well-known measure featly move,
Thoughtless, as if on shore they still were free to rove.
XXII.
Through Calpe's straits survey the steepy shore;
Europe and Afric, on each other gaze!
Lands of the dark-eyed maid and dusky Moor,
Alike beheld beneath pale Hecate's blaze:
How softly on the Spanish shore she plays,
Disclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown,
Distinct, though darkening with her waning phase:
But Mauritania's giant-shadows frown,
From mountain-cliff to coast descending sombre down.
XXIII.
'Tis night, when Meditation bids us feel
We once have loved, though love is at an end:
The heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal,
Though friendless now, will dream it had a friend.
Who with the weight of years would wish to bend,
When Youth itself survives young Love and Joy?
Alas! when mingling souls forget to blend,
Death hath but little left him to destroy!
Ah, happy years! once more who would not be a boy?
XXIV.
Thus bending o'er the vessel's laving side,
To gaze on Dian's wave-reflected sphere,
The soul forgets her schemes of Hope and Pride,
And flies unconscious o'er each backward year.
None are so desolate but something dear,
Dearer than self, possesses or possessed
A thought, and claims the homage of a tear;
A flashing pang! of which the weary breast
Would still, albeit in vain, the heavy heart divest.
XXV.
To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,
To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,
Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,
And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;
To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,
With the wild flock that never needs a fold;
Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean:
This is not solitude; 'tis but to hold
Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.
XXVI.
But midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,
To hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,
And roam along, the world's tired denizen,
With none who bless us, none whom we can bless;
Minions of splendour shrinking from distress!
None that, with kindred consciousness endued,
If we were not, would seem to smile the less
Of all that flattered, followed, sought, and sued:
This is to be alone; this, this is solitude!
XXVII.
More blest the life of godly eremite,
Such as on lonely Athos may be seen,
Watching at eve upon the giant height,
Which looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene,
That he who there at such an hour hath been,
Will wistful linger on that hallowed spot;
Then slowly tear him from the witching scene,
Sigh forth one wish that such had been his lot,
Then turn to hate a world he had almost forgot.
XXVIII.
Pass we the long, unvarying course, the track
Oft trod, that never leaves a trace behind;
Pass we the calm, the gale, the change, the tack,
And each well-known caprice of wave and wind;
Pass we the joys and sorrows sailors find,
Cooped in their winged sea-girt citadel;
The foul, the fair, the contrary, the kind,
As breezes rise and fall, and billows swell,
Till on some jocund morn—lo, land! and all is well.
XXIX.
But not in silence pass Calypso's isles,
The sister tenants of the middle deep;
There for the weary still a haven smiles,
Though the fair goddess long has ceased to weep,
And o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep
For him who dared prefer a mortal bride:
Here, too, his boy essayed the dreadful leap
Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;
While thus of both bereft, the nymph-queen doubly sighed.
XXX.
Her reign is past, her gentle glories gone:
But trust not this; too easy youth, beware!
A mortal sovereign holds her dangerous throne,
And thou mayst find a new Calypso there.
Sweet Florence! could another ever share
This wayward, loveless heart, it would be thine:
But checked by every tie, I may not dare
To cast a worthless offering at thy shrine,
Nor ask so dear a breast to feel one pang for mine.
XXXI.
Thus Harold deemed, as on that lady's eye
He looked, and met its beam without a thought,
Save Admiration glancing harmless by:
Love kept aloof, albeit not far remote,
Who knew his votary often lost and caught,
But knew him as his worshipper no more,
And ne'er again the boy his bosom sought:
Since now he vainly urged him to adore,
Well deemed the little god his ancient sway was o'er.
XXXII.
Fair Florence found, in sooth with some amaze,
One who, 'twas said, still sighed to all he saw,
Withstand, unmoved, the lustre of her gaze,
Which others hailed with real or mimic awe,
Their hope, their doom, their punishment, their law:
All that gay Beauty from her bondsmen claims:
And much she marvelled that a youth so raw
Nor felt, nor feigned at least, the oft-told flames,
Which, though sometimes they frown, yet rarely anger dames.
XXXIII.
Little knew she that seeming marble heart,
Now masked by silence or withheld by pride,
Was not unskilful in the spoiler's art,
And spread its snares licentious far and wide;
Nor from the base pursuit had turned aside,
As long as aught was worthy to pursue:
But Harold on such arts no more relied;
And had he doted on those eyes so blue,
Yet never would he join the lover's whining crew.
XXXIV.
Not much he kens, I ween, of woman's breast,
Who thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs;
What careth she for hearts when once possessed?
Do proper homage to thine idol's eyes,
But not too humbly, or she will despise
Thee and thy suit, though told in moving tropes;
Disguise e'en tenderness, if thou art wise;
Brisk Confidence still best with woman copes;
Pique her and soothe in turn, soon Passion crowns thy hopes.
XXXV.
'Tis an old lesson:  Time approves it true,
And those who know it best deplore it most;
When all is won that all desire to woo,
The paltry prize is hardly worth the cost:
Youth wasted, minds degraded, honour lost,
These are thy fruits, successful Passion! these!
If, kindly cruel, early hope is crossed,
Still to the last it rankles, a disease,
Not to be cured when Love itself forgets to please.
XXXVI.
Away! nor let me loiter in my song,
For we have many a mountain path to tread,
And many a varied shore to sail along,
By pensive Sadness, not by Fiction, led—
Climes, fair withal as ever mortal head
Imagined in its little schemes of thought;
Or e'er in new Utopias were read:
To teach man what he might be, or he ought;
If that corrupted thing could ever such be taught.
XXXVII.
Dear Nature is the kindest mother still;
Though always changing, in her aspect mild:
From her bare bosom let me take my fill,
Her never-weaned, though not her favoured child.
Oh! she is fairest in her features wild,
Where nothing polished dares pollute her path:
To me by day or night she ever smiled,
Though I have marked her when none other hath,
And sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.
XXXVIII.
Land of Albania! where Iskander rose;
Theme of the young, and beacon of the wise,
And he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes,
Shrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprise:
Land of Albania! let me bend mine eyes
On thee, thou rugged nurse of savage men!
The cross descends, thy minarets arise,
And the pale crescent sparkles in the glen,
Through many a cypress grove within each city's ken.
XXXIX.
Childe Harold sailed, and passed the barren spot
Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave;
And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,
The lover's refuge, and the Lesbian's grave.
Dark Sappho! could not verse immortal save
That breast imbued with such immortal fire?
Could she not live who life eternal gave?
If life eternal may await the lyre,
That only Heaven to which Earth's children may aspire.
XL.
'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve,
Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;
A spot he longed to see, nor cared to leave:
Oft did he mark the scenes of vanished war,
Actium, Lepanto, fatal Trafalgar:
Mark them unmoved, for he would not delight
(Born beneath some remote inglorious star)
In themes of bloody fray, or gallant fight,
But loathed the bravo's trade, and laughed at martial wight.
XLI.
But when he saw the evening star above
Leucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,
And hailed the last resort of fruitless love,
He felt, or deemed he felt, no common glow:
And as the stately vessel glided slow
Beneath the shadow of that ancient mount,
He watched the billows' melancholy flow,
And, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont,
More placid seemed his eye, and smooth his pallid front.
XLII.
Morn dawns; and with it stern Albania's hills,
Dark Suli's rocks, and Pindus' inland peak,
Robed half in mist, bedewed with snowy rills,
Arrayed in many a dun and purple streak,
Arise; and, as the clouds along them break,
Disclose the dwelling of the mountaineer;
Here roams the wolf, the eagle whets his beak,
Birds, beasts of prey, and wilder men appear,
And gathering storms around convulse the closing year.
XLIII.
Now Harold felt himself at length alone,
And bade to Christian tongues a long adieu:
Now he adventured on a shore unknown,
Which all admire, but many dread to view:
His breast was armed 'gainst fate, his wants were few:
Peril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet:
The scene was savage, but the scene was new;
This made the ceaseless toil of travel sweet,
Beat back keen winter's blast; and welcomed summer's heat.
XLIV.
Here the red cross, for still the cross is here,
Though sadly scoffed at by the circumcised,
Forgets that pride to pampered priesthood dear;
Churchman and votary alike despised.
Foul Superstition! howsoe'er disguised,
Idol, saint, virgin, prophet, crescent, cross,
For whatsoever symbol thou art prized,
Thou sacerdotal gain, but general loss!
Who from true worship's gold can separate thy dross.
XLV.
Ambracia's gulf behold, where once was lost
A world for woman, lovely, harmless thing!
In yonder rippling bay, their naval host
Did many a Roman chief and Asian king
To doubtful conflict, certain slaughter, bring
Look where the second Caesar's trophies rose,
Now, like the hands that reared them, withering;
Imperial anarchs, doubling human woes!
God! was thy globe ordained for such to win and lose?
XLVI.
From the dark barriers of that rugged clime,
E'en to the centre of Illyria's vales,
Childe Harold passed o'er many a mount sublime,
Through lands scarce noticed in historic tales:
Yet in famed Attica such lovely dales
Are rarely seen; nor can fair Tempe boast
A charm they know not; loved Parnassus fails,
Though classic ground, and consecrated most,
To match some spots that lurk within this lowering coast.
XLVII.
He passed bleak Pindus, Acherusia's lake,
And left the primal city of the land,
And onwards did his further journey take
To greet Albania's chief, whose dread command
Is lawless law; for with a bloody hand
He sways a nation, turbulent and bold:
Yet here and there some daring mountain-band
Disdain his power, and from their rocky hold
Hurl their defiance far, nor yield, unless to gold.
XLVIII.
Monastic Zitza! from thy shady brow,
Thou small, but favoured spot of holy ground!
Where'er we gaze, around, above, below,
What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!
Rock, river, forest, mountain all abound,
And bluest skies that harmonise the whole:
Beneath, the distant torrent's rushing sound
Tells where the volumed cataract doth roll
Between those hanging rocks, that shock yet please the soul.
XLIX.
Amidst the grove that crowns yon tufted hill,
Which, were it not for many a mountain nigh
Rising in lofty ranks, and loftier still,
Might well itself be deemed of dignity,
The convent's white walls glisten fair on high;
Here dwells the caloyer, nor rude is he,
Nor niggard of his cheer:  the passer-by
Is welcome still; nor heedless will he flee
From hence, if he delight kind Nature's sheen to see.
L.
Here in the sultriest season let him rest,
Fresh is the green beneath those aged trees;
Here winds of gentlest wing will fan his breast,
From heaven itself he may inhale the breeze:
The plain is far beneath—oh! let him seize
Pure pleasure while he can; the scorching ray
Here pierceth not, impregnate with disease:
Then let his length the loitering pilgrim lay,
And gaze, untired, the morn, the noon, the eve away.
LI.
Dusky and huge, enlarging on the sight,
Nature's volcanic amphitheatre,
Chimera's alps extend from left to right:
Beneath, a living valley seems to stir;
Flocks play, trees wave, streams flow, the mountain fir
Nodding above; behold black Acheron!
Once consecrated to the sepulchre.
Pluto! if this be hell I look upon,
Close shamed Elysium's gates, my shade shall seek for none.
LII.
No city's towers pollute the lovely view;
Unseen is Yanina, though not remote,
Veiled by the screen of hills:  here men are few,
Scanty the hamlet, rare the lonely cot;
But, peering down each precipice, the goat
Browseth:  and, pensive o'er his scattered flock,
The little shepherd in his white capote
Doth lean his boyish form along the rock,
Or in his cave awaits the tempest's short-lived shock.
LIII.
Oh! where, Dodona, is thine aged grove,
Prophetic fount, and oracle divine?
What valley echoed the response of Jove?
What trace remaineth of the Thunderer's shrine?
All, all forgotten—and shall man repine
That his frail bonds to fleeting life are broke?
Cease, fool! the fate of gods may well be thine:
Wouldst thou survive the marble or the oak,
When nations, tongues, and worlds must sink beneath the stroke?
LIV.
Epirus' bounds recede, and mountains fail;
Tired of up-gazing still, the wearied eye
Reposes gladly on as smooth a vale
As ever Spring yclad in grassy dye:
E'en on a plain no humble beauties lie,
Where some bold river breaks the long expanse,
And woods along the banks are waving high,
Whose shadows in the glassy waters dance,
Or with the moonbeam sleep in Midnight's solemn trance.
LV.
The sun had sunk behind vast Tomerit,
The Laos wide and fierce came roaring by;
The shades of wonted night were gathering yet,
When, down the steep banks winding wearily
Childe Harold saw, like meteors in the sky,
The glittering minarets of Tepalen,
Whose walls o'erlook the stream; and drawing nigh,
He heard the busy hum of warrior-men
Swelling the breeze that sighed along the lengthening glen.
LVI.
He passed the sacred harem's silent tower,
And underneath the wide o'erarching gate
Surveyed the dwelling of this chief of power
Where all around proclaimed his high estate.
Amidst no common pomp the despot sate,
While busy preparation shook the court;
Slaves, eunuchs, soldiers, guests, and santons wait;
Within, a palace, and without a fort,
Here men of every clime appear to make resort.
LVII.
Richly caparisoned, a ready row
Of armed horse, and many a warlike store,
Circled the wide-extending court below;
Above, strange groups adorned the corridor;
And ofttimes through the area's echoing door,
Some high-capped Tartar spurred his steed away;
The Turk, the Greek, the Albanian, and the Moor,
Here mingled in their many-hued array,
While the deep war-drum's sound announced the close of day.
LVIII.
The wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,
With shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,
And gold-embroidered garments, fair to see:
The crimson-scarfed men of Macedon;
The Delhi with his cap of terror on,
And crooked glaive; the lively, supple Greek;
And swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;
The bearded Turk, that rarely deigns to speak,
Master of all around, too potent to be meek,
LIX.
Are mixed conspicuous:  some recline in groups,
Scanning the motley scene that varies round;
There some grave Moslem to devotion stoops,
And some that smoke, and some that play are found;
Here the Albanian proudly treads the ground;
Half-whispering there the Greek is heard to prate;
Hark! from the mosque the nightly solemn sound,
The muezzin's call doth shake the minaret,
'There is no god but God!—to prayer—lo! God is great!'
LX.
Just at this season Ramazani's fast
Through the long day its penance did maintain.
But when the lingering twilight hour was past,
Revel and feast assumed the rule again:
Now all was bustle, and the menial train
Prepared and spread the plenteous board within;
The vacant gallery now seemed made in vain,
But from the chambers came the mingling din,
As page and slave anon were passing out and in.
LXI.
Here woman's voice is never heard:  apart
And scarce permitted, guarded, veiled, to move,
She yields to one her person and her heart,
Tamed to her cage, nor feels a wish to rove;
For, not unhappy in her master's love,
And joyful in a mother's gentlest cares,
Blest cares! all other feelings far above!
Herself more sweetly rears the babe she bears,
Who never quits the breast, no meaner passion shares.
LXII.
In marble-paved pavilion, where a spring
Of living water from the centre rose,
Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,
And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose,
Ali reclined, a man of war and woes:
Yet in his lineaments ye cannot trace,
While Gentleness her milder radiance throws
Along that aged venerable face,
The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.
LXIII.
It is not that yon hoary lengthening beard
Ill suits the passions which belong to youth:
Love conquers age—so Hafiz hath averred,
So sings the Teian, and he sings in sooth—
But crimes that scorn the tender voice of ruth,
Beseeming all men ill, but most the man
In years, have marked him with a tiger's tooth:
Blood follows blood, and through their mortal span,
In bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.
LXIV.
Mid many things most new to ear and eye,
The pilgrim rested here his weary feet,
And gazed around on Moslem luxury,
Till quickly wearied with that spacious seat
Of Wealth and Wantonness, the choice retreat
Of sated Grandeur from the city's noise:
And were it humbler, it in sooth were sweet;
But Peace abhorreth artificial joys,
And Pleasure, leagued with Pomp, the zest of both destroys.
LXV.
Fierce are Albania's children, yet they lack
Not virtues, were those virtues more mature.
Where is the foe that ever saw their back?
Who can so well the toil of war endure?
Their native fastnesses not more secure
Than they in doubtful time of troublous need:
Their wrath how deadly! but their friendship sure,
When Gratitude or Valour bids them bleed,
Unshaken rushing on where'er their chief may lead.
LXVI.
Childe Harold saw them in their chieftain's tower,
Thronging to war in splendour and success;
And after viewed them, when, within their power,
Himself awhile the victim of distress;
That saddening hour when bad men hotlier press:
But these did shelter him beneath their roof,
When less barbarians would have cheered him less,
And fellow-countrymen have stood aloof—
In aught that tries the heart how few withstand the proof!
LXVII.
It chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark
Full on the coast of Suli's shaggy shore,
When all around was desolate and dark;
To land was perilous, to sojourn more;
Yet for awhile the mariners forbore,
Dubious to trust where treachery might lurk:
At length they ventured forth, though doubting sore
That those who loathe alike the Frank and Turk
Might once again renew their ancient butcher-work.
LXVIII.
Vain fear! the Suliotes stretched the welcome hand,
Led them o'er rocks and past the dangerous swamp,
Kinder than polished slaves, though not so bland,
And piled the hearth, and wrung their garments damp,
And filled the bowl, and trimmed the cheerful lamp,
And spread their fare:  though homely, all they had:
Such conduct bears Philanthropy's rare stamp—
To rest the weary and to soothe the sad,
Doth lesson happier men, and shames at least the bad.
LXIX.
It came to pass, that when he did address
Himself to quit at length this mountain land,
Combined marauders half-way barred egress,
And wasted far and near with glaive and brand;
And therefore did he take a trusty band
To traverse Acarnania forest wide,
In war well-seasoned, and with labours tanned,
Till he did greet white Achelous' tide,
And from his farther bank AEtolia's wolds espied.
LXX.
Where lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,
And weary waves retire to gleam at rest,
How brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,
Nodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,
As winds come whispering lightly from the west,
Kissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene:
Here Harold was received a welcome guest;
Nor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,
For many a joy could he from night's soft presence glean.
LXXI.
On the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,
The feast was done, the red wine circling fast,
And he that unawares had there ygazed
With gaping wonderment had stared aghast;
For ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,
The native revels of the troop began;
Each palikar his sabre from him cast,
And bounding hand in hand, man linked to man,
Yelling their uncouth dirge, long danced the kirtled clan.
LXXII.
Childe Harold at a little distance stood,
And viewed, but not displeased, the revelrie,
Nor hated harmless mirth, however rude:
In sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see
Their barbarous, yet their not indecent, glee:
And as the flames along their faces gleamed,
Their gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,
The long wild locks that to their girdles streamed,
While thus in concert they this lay half sang, half screamed:
Tambourgi! Tambourgi! thy larum afar
Gives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;
All the sons of the mountains arise at the note,
Chimariot, Illyrian, and dark Suliote!
Oh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,
To his snowy camese and his shaggy capote?
To the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,
And descends to the plain like the stream from the rock.
Shall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive
The fault of a friend, bid an enemy live?
Let those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?
What mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?
Macedonia sends forth her invincible race;
For a time they abandon the cave and the chase:
But those scarves of blood-red shall be redder, before
The sabre is sheathed and the battle is o'er.
Then the pirates of Parga that dwell by the waves,
And teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,
Shall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,
And track to his covert the captive on shore.
I ask not the pleasure that riches supply,
My sabre shall win what the feeble must buy:
Shall win the young bride with her long flowing hair,
And many a maid from her mother shall tear.
I love the fair face of the maid in her youth;
Her caresses shall lull me, her music shall soothe:
Let her bring from her chamber the many-toned lyre,
And sing us a song on the fall of her sire.
Remember the moment when Previsa fell,
The shrieks of the conquered, the conqueror's yell;
The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared,
The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared.
I talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;
He neither must know who would serve the Vizier;
Since the days of our prophet, the crescent ne'er saw
A chief ever glorious like Ali Pasha.
Dark Muchtar his son to the Danube is sped,
Let the yellow-haired Giaours view his horsetail with dread;
When his Delhis come dashing in blood o'er the banks,
How few shall escape from the Muscovite ranks!
Selictar! unsheath then our chief's scimitar:
Tambourgi! thy larum gives promise of war.
Ye mountains that see us descend to the shore,
Shall view us as victors, or view us no more!
LXXIII.
Fair Greece! sad relic of departed worth!
Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great!
Who now shall lead thy scattered children forth,
And long accustomed bondage uncreate?
Not such thy sons who whilome did await,
The hopeless warriors of a willing doom,
In bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait—
Oh, who that gallant spirit shall resume,
Leap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?
LXXIV.
Spirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow
Thou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,
Couldst thou forbode the dismal hour which now
Dims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?
Not thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,
But every carle can lord it o'er thy land;
Nor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,
Trembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,
From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.
LXXV.
In all save form alone, how changed! and who
That marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,
Who would but deem their bosom burned anew
With thy unquenched beam, lost Liberty!
And many dream withal the hour is nigh
That gives them back their fathers' heritage:
For foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,
Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage,
Or tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.
LXXVI.
Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not
Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?
By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?
Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye?  No!
True, they may lay your proud despoilers low,
But not for you will Freedom's altars flame.
Shades of the Helots! triumph o'er your foe:
Greece! change thy lords, thy state is still the same;
Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thy years of shame.
LXXVII.
The city won for Allah from the Giaour,
The Giaour from Othman's race again may wrest;
And the Serai's impenetrable tower
Receive the fiery Frank, her former guest;
Or Wahab's rebel brood, who dared divest
The Prophet's tomb of all its pious spoil,
May wind their path of blood along the West;
But ne'er will Freedom seek this fated soil,
But slave succeed to slave through years of endless toil.
LXXVIII.
Yet mark their mirth—ere lenten days begin,
That penance which their holy rites prepare
To shrive from man his weight of mortal sin,
By daily abstinence and nightly prayer;
But ere his sackcloth garb Repentance wear,
Some days of joyaunce are decreed to all,
To take of pleasaunce each his secret share,
In motley robe to dance at masking ball,
And join the mimic train of merry Carnival.
LXXIX.
And whose more rife with merriment than thine,
O Stamboul! once the empress of their reign?
Though turbans now pollute Sophia's shrine
And Greece her very altars eyes in vain:
(Alas! her woes will still pervade my strain!)
Gay were her minstrels once, for free her throng,
All felt the common joy they now must feign;
Nor oft I've seen such sight, nor heard such song,
As wooed the eye, and thrilled the Bosphorus along.
LXXX.
Loud was the lightsome tumult on the shore;
Oft Music changed, but never ceased her tone,
And timely echoed back the measured oar,
And rippling waters made a pleasant moan:
The Queen of tides on high consenting shone;
And when a transient breeze swept o'er the wave,
'Twas as if, darting from her heavenly throne,
A brighter glance her form reflected gave,
Till sparkling billows seemed to light the banks they lave.
LXXXI.
Glanced many a light caique along the foam,
Danced on the shore the daughters of the land,
No thought had man or maid of rest or home,
While many a languid eye and thrilling hand
Exchanged the look few bosoms may withstand,
Or gently pressed, returned the pressure still:
Oh Love! young Love! bound in thy rosy band,
Let sage or cynic prattle as he will,
These hours, and only these, redeemed Life's years of ill!
LXXXII.
But, midst the throng in merry masquerade,
Lurk there no hearts that throb with secret pain,
E'en through the closest searment half-betrayed?
To such the gentle murmurs of the main
Seem to re-echo all they mourn in vain;
To such the gladness of the gamesome crowd
Is source of wayward thought and stern disdain:
How do they loathe the laughter idly loud,
And long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!
LXXXIII.
This must he feel, the true-born son of Greece,
If Greece one true-born patriot can boast:
Not such as prate of war but skulk in peace,
The bondsman's peace, who sighs for all he lost,
Yet with smooth smile his tyrant can accost,
And wield the slavish sickle, not the sword:
Ah, Greece! they love thee least who owe thee most—
Their birth, their blood, and that sublime record
Of hero sires, who shame thy now degenerate horde!
LXXXIV.
When riseth Lacedaemon's hardihood,
When Thebes Epaminondas rears again,
When Athens' children are with hearts endued,
When Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,
Then mayst thou be restored; but not till then.
A thousand years scarce serve to form a state;
An hour may lay it in the dust:  and when
Can man its shattered splendour renovate,
Recall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate?
LXXXV.
And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,
Land of lost gods and godlike men, art thou!
Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,
Proclaim thee Nature's varied favourite now;
Thy fanes, thy temples to the surface bow,
Commingling slowly with heroic earth,
Broke by the share of every rustic plough:
So perish monuments of mortal birth,
So perish all in turn, save well-recorded worth;
LXXXVI.
Save where some solitary column mourns
Above its prostrate brethren of the cave;
Save where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns
Colonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave;
Save o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,
Where the grey stones and unmolested grass
Ages, but not oblivion, feebly brave,
While strangers only not regardless pass,
Lingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh 'Alas!'
LXXXVII.
Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild:
Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,
Thine olives ripe as when Minerva smiled,
And still his honeyed wealth Hymettus yields;
There the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,
The freeborn wanderer of thy mountain air;
Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,
Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare;
Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.
LXXXVIII.
Where'er we tread, 'tis haunted, holy ground;
No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,
But one vast realm of wonder spreads around,
And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,
Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:
Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,
Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:
Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon.
LXXXIX.
The sun, the soil, but not the slave, the same;
Unchanged in all except its foreign lord—
Preserves alike its bounds and boundless fame;
The battle-field, where Persia's victim horde
First bowed beneath the brunt of Hellas' sword,
As on the morn to distant Glory dear,
When Marathon became a magic word;
Which uttered, to the hearer's eye appear
The camp, the host, the fight, the conqueror's career.
XC.
The flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow;
The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;
Mountains above, Earth's, Ocean's plain below;
Death in the front, Destruction in the rear!
Such was the scene—what now remaineth here?
What sacred trophy marks the hallowed ground,
Recording Freedom's smile and Asia's tear?
The rifled urn, the violated mound,
The dust thy courser's hoof, rude stranger! spurns around.
XCI.
Yet to the remnants of thy splendour past
Shall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng:
Long shall the voyager, with th' Ionian blast,
Hail the bright clime of battle and of song;
Long shall thine annals and immortal tongue
Fill with thy fame the youth of many a shore:
Boast of the aged! lesson of the young!
Which sages venerate and bards adore,
As Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.
XCII.
The parted bosom clings to wonted home,
If aught that's kindred cheer the welcome hearth;
He that is lonely, hither let him roam,
And gaze complacent on congenial earth.
Greece is no lightsome land of social mirth;
But he whom Sadness sootheth may abide,
And scarce regret the region of his birth,
When wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side,
Or gazing o'er the plains where Greek and Persian died.
XCIII.
Let such approach this consecrated land,
And pass in peace along the magic waste:
But spare its relics—let no busy hand
Deface the scenes, already how defaced!
Not for such purpose were these altars placed.
Revere the remnants nations once revered;
So may our country's name be undisgraced,
So mayst thou prosper where thy youth was reared,
By every honest joy of love and life endeared!
XCIV.
For thee, who thus in too protracted song
Hath soothed thine idlesse with inglorious lays,
Soon shall thy voice be lost amid the throng
Of louder minstrels in these later days:
To such resign the strife for fading bays—
Ill may such contest now the spirit move
Which heeds nor keen reproach nor partial praise,
Since cold each kinder heart that might approve,
And none are left to please where none are left to love.
XCV.
Thou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one!
Whom youth and youth's affections bound to me;
Who did for me what none beside have done,
Nor shrank from one albeit unworthy thee.
What is my being? thou hast ceased to be!
Nor stayed to welcome here thy wanderer home,
Who mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see—
Would they had never been, or were to come!
Would he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam!
XCVI.
Oh! ever loving, lovely, and beloved!
How selfish Sorrow ponders on the past,
And clings to thoughts now better far removed!
But Time shall tear thy shadow from me last.
All thou couldst have of mine, stern Death, thou hast:
The parent, friend, and now the more than friend;
Ne'er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,
And grief with grief continuing still to blend,
Hath snatched the little joy that life had yet to lend.
XCVII.
Then must I plunge again into the crowd,
And follow all that Peace disdains to seek?
Where Revel calls, and Laughter, vainly loud,
False to the heart, distorts the hollow cheek,
To leave the flagging spirit doubly weak!
Still o'er the features, which perforce they cheer,
To feign the pleasure or conceal the pique;
Smiles form the channel of a future tear,
Or raise the writhing lip with ill-dissembled sneer.
XCVIII.
What is the worst of woes that wait on age?
What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow?
To view each loved one blotted from life's page,
And be alone on earth, as I am now.
Before the Chastener humbly let me bow,
O'er hearts divided and o'er hopes destroyed:
Roll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow,
Since Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoyed,
And with the ills of eld mine earlier years alloyed.


CANTO THE THIRD.
I.
Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child!
Ada! sole daughter of my house and heart?
When last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,
And then we parted,—not as now we part,
But with a hope.—
Awaking with a start,
The waters heave around me; and on high
The winds lift up their voices:  I depart,
Whither I know not; but the hour's gone by,
When Albion's lessening shores could grieve or glad mine eye.
II.
Once more upon the waters! yet once more!
And the waves bound beneath me as a steed
That knows his rider.  Welcome to their roar!
Swift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!
Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed,
And the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale,
Still must I on; for I am as a weed,
Flung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail
Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.
III.
In my youth's summer I did sing of One,
The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;
Again I seize the theme, then but begun,
And bear it with me, as the rushing wind
Bears the cloud onwards:  in that tale I find
The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,
Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,
O'er which all heavily the journeying years
Plod the last sands of life—where not a flower appears.
IV.
Since my young days of passion—joy, or pain,
Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string,
And both may jar:  it may be, that in vain
I would essay as I have sung to sing.
Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling,
So that it wean me from the weary dream
Of selfish grief or gladness—so it fling
Forgetfulness around me—it shall seem
To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.
V.
He who, grown aged in this world of woe,
In deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,
So that no wonder waits him; nor below
Can love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,
Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
Of silent, sharp endurance:  he can tell
Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife
With airy images, and shapes which dwell
Still unimpaired, though old, in the soul's haunted cell.
VI.
'Tis to create, and in creating live
A being more intense, that we endow
With form our fancy, gaining as we give
The life we image, even as I do now.
What am I?  Nothing:  but not so art thou,
Soul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,
Invisible but gazing, as I glow
Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,
And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.
VII.
Yet must I think less wildly:  I HAVE thought
Too long and darkly, till my brain became,
In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,
A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:
And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
My springs of life were poisoned.  'Tis too late!
Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
In strength to bear what time cannot abate,
And feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate.
VIII.
Something too much of this:  but now 'tis past,
And the spell closes with its silent seal.
Long-absent Harold reappears at last;
He of the breast which fain no more would feel,
Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;
Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him
In soul and aspect as in age:  years steal
Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb;
And life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.
IX.
His had been quaffed too quickly, and he found
The dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,
And from a purer fount, on holier ground,
And deemed its spring perpetual; but in vain!
Still round him clung invisibly a chain
Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,
And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,
Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,
Entering with every step he took through many a scene.
X.
Secure in guarded coldness, he had mixed
Again in fancied safety with his kind,
And deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed
And sheathed with an invulnerable mind,
That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;
And he, as one, might midst the many stand
Unheeded, searching through the crowd to find
Fit speculation; such as in strange land
He found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.
XI.
But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek
To wear it? who can curiously behold
The smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek,
Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?
Who can contemplate fame through clouds unfold
The star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?
Harold, once more within the vortex rolled
On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,
Yet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime.
XII.
But soon he knew himself the most unfit
Of men to herd with Man; with whom he held
Little in common; untaught to submit
His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled,
In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,
He would not yield dominion of his mind
To spirits against whom his own rebelled;
Proud though in desolation; which could find
A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.
XIII.
Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;
Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;
Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,
He had the passion and the power to roam;
The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,
Were unto him companionship; they spake
A mutual language, clearer than the tome
Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake
For nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.
XIV.
Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,
Till he had peopled them with beings bright
As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,
And human frailties, were forgotten quite:
Could he have kept his spirit to that flight,
He had been happy; but this clay will sink
Its spark immortal, envying it the light
To which it mounts, as if to break the link
That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.
XV.
But in Man's dwellings he became a thing
Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,
Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,
To whom the boundless air alone were home:
Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,
As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat
His breast and beak against his wiry dome
Till the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat
Of his impeded soul would through his bosom eat.
XVI.
Self-exiled Harold wanders forth again,
With naught of hope left, but with less of gloom;
The very knowledge that he lived in vain,
That all was over on this side the tomb,
Had made Despair a smilingness assume,
Which, though 'twere wild—as on the plundered wreck
When mariners would madly meet their doom
With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck—
Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.
XVII.
Stop! for thy tread is on an empire's dust!
An earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!
Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?
Nor column trophied for triumphal show?
None; but the moral's truth tells simpler so,
As the ground was before, thus let it be;—
How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
And is this all the world has gained by thee,
Thou first and last of fields! king-making Victory?
XVIII.
And Harold stands upon this place of skulls,
The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!
How in an hour the power which gave annuls
Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!
In 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,
Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,
Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through:
Ambition's life and labours all were vain;
He wears the shattered links of the world's broken chain.
XIX.
Fit retribution!  Gaul may champ the bit,
And foam in fetters, but is Earth more free?
Did nations combat to make ONE submit;
Or league to teach all kings true sovereignty?
What! shall reviving thraldom again be
The patched-up idol of enlightened days?
Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we
Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze
And servile knees to thrones?  No; PROVE before ye praise!
XX.
If not, o'er one fall'n despot boast no more!
In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears
For Europe's flowers long rooted up before
The trampler of her vineyards; in vain years
Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,
Have all been borne, and broken by the accord
Of roused-up millions:  all that most endears
Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword
Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant lord.
XXI.
There was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage bell;
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!
XXII.
Did ye not hear it?—No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet.
But hark!—that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
Arm! arm! it is—it is—the cannon's opening roar!
XXIII.
Within a windowed niche of that high hall
Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear
That sound, the first amidst the festival,
And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
His heart more truly knew that peal too well
Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:
He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.
XXIV.
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated:  who would guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!
XXV.
And there was mounting in hot haste:  the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
And near, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering, with white lips—'The foe!  They come! they come!'
XXVI.
And wild and high the 'Cameron's gathering' rose,
The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:
How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills
Savage and shrill!  But with the breath which fills
Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers
With the fierce native daring which instils
The stirring memory of a thousand years,
And Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears.
XXVII.
And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,
Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
Over the unreturniug brave,—alas!
Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
Of living valour, rolling on the foe,
And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.
XXVIII.
Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,
Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,
The morn the marshalling in arms,—the day
Battle's magnificently stern array!
The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
The earth is covered thick with other clay,
Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
Rider and horse,—friend, foe,—in one red burial blent!
XXIX.
Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
Yet one I would select from that proud throng,
Partly because they blend me with his line,
And partly that I did his sire some wrong,
And partly that bright names will hallow song;
And his was of the bravest, and when showered
The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,
Even where the thickest of war's tempest lowered,
They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!
XXX.
There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,
And mine were nothing, had I such to give;
But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,
Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,
And saw around me the wild field revive
With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring
Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,
With all her reckless birds upon the wing,
I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.
XXXI.
I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each
And one as all a ghastly gap did make
In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
The Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake
Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame
May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake
The fever of vain longing, and the name
So honoured, but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.
XXXII.
They mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:
The tree will wither long before it fall:
The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;
The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall
In massy hoariness; the ruined wall
Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;
The bars survive the captive they enthral;
The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;
And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:
XXXIII.
E'en as a broken mirror, which the glass
In every fragment multiplies; and makes
A thousand images of one that was,
The same, and still the more, the more it breaks;
And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,
Living in shattered guise, and still, and cold,
And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
Yet withers on till all without is old,
Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.
XXXIV.
There is a very life in our despair,
Vitality of poison,—a quick root
Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were
As nothing did we die; but life will suit
Itself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,
Like to the apples on the Dead Sea shore,
All ashes to the taste:  Did man compute
Existence by enjoyment, and count o'er
Such hours 'gainst years of life,—say, would he name threescore?
XXXV.
The Psalmist numbered out the years of man:
They are enough:  and if thy tale be TRUE,
Thou, who didst grudge him e'en that fleeting span,
More than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!
Millions of tongues record thee, and anew
Their children's lips shall echo them, and say,
'Here, where the sword united nations drew,
Our countrymen were warring on that day!'
And this is much, and all which will not pass away.
XXXVI.
There sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,
Whose spirit anithetically mixed
One moment of the mightiest, and again
On little objects with like firmness fixed;
Extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,
Thy throne had still been thine, or never been;
For daring made thy rise as fall:  thou seek'st
Even now to reassume the imperial mien,
And shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!
XXXVII.
Conqueror and captive of the earth art thou!
She trembles at thee still, and thy wild name
Was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now
That thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,
Who wooed thee once, thy vassal, and became
The flatterer of thy fierceness, till thou wert
A god unto thyself; nor less the same
To the astounded kingdoms all inert,
Who deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.
XXXVIII.
Oh, more or less than man—in high or low,
Battling with nations, flying from the field;
Now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now
More than thy meanest soldier taught to yield:
An empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,
But govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,
However deeply in men's spirits skilled,
Look through thine own, nor curb the lust of war,
Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.
XXXIX.
Yet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide
With that untaught innate philosophy,
Which, be it wisdom, coldness, or deep pride,
Is gall and wormwood to an enemy.
When the whole host of hatred stood hard by,
To watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled
With a sedate and all-enduring eye;
When Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,
He stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.
XL.
Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them
Ambition steeled thee on to far too show
That just habitual scorn, which could contemn
Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so
To wear it ever on thy lip and brow,
And spurn the instruments thou wert to use
Till they were turned unto thine overthrow:
'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;
So hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.
XLI.
If, like a tower upon a headland rock,
Thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,
Such scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;
But men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,
THEIR admiration thy best weapon shone;
The part of Philip's son was thine, not then
(Unless aside thy purple had been thrown)
Like stern Diogenes to mock at men;
For sceptred cynics earth were far too wide a den.
XLII.
But quiet to quick bosoms is a hell,
And THERE hath been thy bane; there is a fire
And motion of the soul, which will not dwell
In its own narrow being, but aspire
Beyond the fitting medium of desire;
And, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,
Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire
Of aught but rest; a fever at the core,
Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.
XLIII.
This makes the madmen who have made men mad
By their contagion!  Conquerors and Kings,
Founders of sects and systems, to whom add
Sophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things
Which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,
And are themselves the fools to those they fool;
Envied, yet how unenviable! what stings
Are theirs!  One breast laid open were a school
Which would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule:
XLIV.
Their breath is agitation, and their life
A storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,
And yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,
That should their days, surviving perils past,
Melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast
With sorrow and supineness, and so die;
Even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste
With its own flickering, or a sword laid by,
Which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.
XLV.
He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find
The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;
He who surpasses or subdues mankind,
Must look down on the hate of those below.
Though high ABOVE the sun of glory glow,
And far BENEATH the earth and ocean spread,
ROUND him are icy rocks, and loudly blow
Contending tempests on his naked head,
And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.
XLVI.
Away with these; true Wisdom's world will be
Within its own creation, or in thine,
Maternal Nature! for who teems like thee,
Thus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?
There Harold gazes on a work divine,
A blending of all beauties; streams and dells,
Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, corn-field, mountain, vine,
And chiefless castles breathing stern farewells
From grey but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.
XLVII.
And there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,
Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,
All tenantless, save to the crannying wind,
Or holding dark communion with the cloud.
There was a day when they were young and proud,
Banners on high, and battles passed below;
But they who fought are in a bloody shroud,
And those which waved are shredless dust ere now,
And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.
XLVIII.
Beneath these battlements, within those walls,
Power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state
Each robber chief upheld his armed halls,
Doing his evil will, nor less elate
Than mightier heroes of a longer date.
What want these outlaws conquerors should have
But History's purchased page to call them great?
A wider space, an ornamented grave?
Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.
XLIX.
In their baronial feuds and single fields,
What deeds of prowess unrecorded died!
And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,
With emblems well devised by amorous pride,
Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;
But still their flame was fierceness, and drew on
Keen contest and destruction near allied,
And many a tower for some fair mischief won,
Saw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.
L.
But thou, exulting and abounding river!
Making thy waves a blessing as they flow
Through banks whose beauty would endure for ever,
Could man but leave thy bright creation so,
Nor its fair promise from the surface mow
With the sharp scythe of conflict,—then to see
Thy valley of sweet waters, were to know
Earth paved like Heaven; and to seem such to me
Even now what wants thy stream?—that it should Lethe be.
LI.
A thousand battles have assailed thy banks,
But these and half their fame have passed away,
And Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:
Their very graves are gone, and what are they?
Thy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,
And all was stainless, and on thy clear stream
Glassed with its dancing light the sunny ray;
But o'er the blackened memory's blighting dream
Thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.
LII.
Thus Harold inly said, and passed along,
Yet not insensible to all which here
Awoke the jocund birds to early song
In glens which might have made e'en exile dear:
Though on his brow were graven lines austere,
And tranquil sternness which had ta'en the place
Of feelings fierier far but less severe,
Joy was not always absent from his face,
But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.
LIII.
Nor was all love shut from him, though his days
Of passion had consumed themselves to dust.
It is in vain that we would coldly gaze
On such as smile upon us; the heart must
Leap kindly back to kindness, though disgust
Hath weaned it from all worldlings:  thus he felt,
For there was soft remembrance, and sweet trust
In one fond breast, to which his own would melt,
And in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.
LIV.
And he had learned to love,—I know not why,
For this in such as him seems strange of mood,—
The helpless looks of blooming infancy,
Even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,
To change like this, a mind so far imbued
With scorn of man, it little boots to know;
But thus it was; and though in solitude
Small power the nipped affections have to grow,
In him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.
LV.
And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,
Which unto his was bound by stronger ties
Than the church links withal; and, though unwed,
THAT love was pure, and, far above disguise,
Had stood the test of mortal enmities
Still undivided, and cemented more
By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;
But this was firm, and from a foreign shore
Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!
The castled crag of Drachenfels
Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine.
Whose breast of waters broadly swells
Between the banks which bear the vine,
And hills all rich with blossomed trees,
And fields which promise corn and wine,
And scattered cities crowning these,
Whose far white walls along them shine,
Have strewed a scene, which I should see
With double joy wert THOU with me!
And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,
And hands which offer early flowers,
Walk smiling o'er this paradise;
Above, the frequent feudal towers
Through green leaves lift their walls of grey,
And many a rock which steeply lours,
And noble arch in proud decay,
Look o'er this vale of vintage bowers:
But one thing want these banks of Rhine,—
Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!
I send the lilies given to me;
Though long before thy hand they touch,
I know that they must withered be,
But yet reject them not as such;
For I have cherished them as dear,
Because they yet may meet thine eye,
And guide thy soul to mine e'en here,
When thou behold'st them drooping nigh,
And know'st them gathered by the Rhine,
And offered from my heart to thine!
The river nobly foams and flows,
The charm of this enchanted ground,
And all its thousand turns disclose
Some fresher beauty varying round;
The haughtiest breast its wish might bound
Through life to dwell delighted here;
Nor could on earth a spot be found
To Nature and to me so dear,
Could thy dear eyes in following mine
Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!
LVI.
By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,
There is a small and simple pyramid,
Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;
Beneath its base are heroes' ashes hid,
Our enemy's,—but let not that forbid
Honour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb
Tears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,
Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,
Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.
LVI.
Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career,—
His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;
And fitly may the stranger lingering here
Pray for his gallant spirit's bright repose;
For he was Freedom's champion, one of those,
The few in number, who had not o'erstept
The charter to chastise which she bestows
On such as wield her weapons; he had kept
The whiteness of his soul, and thus men o'er him wept.
LVIII.
Here Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall
Black with the miner's blast, upon her height
Yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball
Rebounding idly on her strength did light;
A tower of victory! from whence the flight
Of baffled foes was watched along the plain;
But Peace destroyed what War could never blight,
And laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain—
On which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.
LIX.
Adieu to thee, fair Rhine!  How long, delighted,
The stranger fain would linger on his way;
Thine is a scene alike where souls united
Or lonely Contemplation thus might stray;
And could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey
On self-condemning bosoms, it were here,
Where Nature, not too sombre nor too gay,
Wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,
Is to the mellow earth as autumn to the year.
LX.
Adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!
There can be no farewell to scene like thine;
The mind is coloured by thy every hue;
And if reluctantly the eyes resign
Their cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!
'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;
More mighty spots may rise—more glaring shine,
But none unite in one attaching maze
The brilliant, fair, and soft;—the glories of old days.
LXI.
The negligently grand, the fruitful bloom
Of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,
The rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,
The forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,
The wild rocks shaped as they had turrets been
In mockery of man's art; and these withal
A race of faces happy as the scene,
Whose fertile bounties here extend to all,
Still springing o'er thy banks, though empires near them fall.
LXII.
But these recede.  Above me are the Alps,
The palaces of Nature, whose vast walls
Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,
And throned Eternity in icy halls
Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls
The avalanche—the thunderbolt of snow!
All that expands the spirit, yet appals,
Gathers around these summits, as to show
How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.
LXIII.
But ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,
There is a spot should not be passed in vain,—
Morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man
May gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,
Nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;
Here Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,
A bony heap, through ages to remain,
Themselves their monument;—the Stygian coast
Unsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each wandering ghost.
LXIV.
While Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,
Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;
They were true Glory's stainless victories,
Won by the unambitious heart and hand
Of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,
All unbought champions in no princely cause
Of vice-entailed Corruption; they no land
Doomed to bewail the blasphemy of laws
Making king's rights divine, by some Draconic clause.
LXV.
By a lone wall a lonelier column rears
A grey and grief-worn aspect of old days
'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,
And looks as with the wild bewildered gaze
Of one to stone converted by amaze,
Yet still with consciousness; and there it stands,
Making a marvel that it not decays,
When the coeval pride of human hands,
Levelled Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.
LXVI.
And there—oh! sweet and sacred be the name!—
Julia—the daughter, the devoted—gave
Her youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim
Nearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.
Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave
The life she lived in; but the judge was just,
And then she died on him she could not save.
Their tomb was simple, and without a bust,
And held within their urn one mind, one heart, one dust.
LXVII.
But these are deeds which should not pass away,
And names that must not wither, though the earth
Forgets her empires with a just decay,
The enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;
The high, the mountain-majesty of worth,
Should be, and shall, survivor of its woe,
And from its immortality look forth
In the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,
Imperishably pure beyond all things below.
LXVIII.
Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,
The mirror where the stars and mountains view
The stillness of their aspect in each trace
Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:
There is too much of man here, to look through
With a fit mind the might which I behold;
But soon in me shall Loneliness renew
Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,
Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.
LXIX.
To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind;
All are not fit with them to stir and toil,
Nor is it discontent to keep the mind
Deep in its fountain, lest it overboil
In one hot throng, where we become the spoil
Of our infection, till too late and long
We may deplore and struggle with the coil,
In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong
Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.
LXX.
There, in a moment, we may plunge our years
In fatal penitence, and in the blight
Of our own soul, turn all our blood to tears,
And colour things to come with hues of Night;
The race of life becomes a hopeless flight
To those that walk in darkness:  on the sea,
The boldest steer but where their ports invite,
But there are wanderers o'er Eternity
Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.
LXXI.
Is it not better, then, to be alone,
And love Earth only for its earthly sake?
By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,
Or the pure bosom of its nursing lake,
Which feeds it as a mother who doth make
A fair but froward infant her own care,
Kissing its cries away as these awake;—
Is it not better thus our lives to wear,
Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?
LXXII.
I live not in myself, but I become
Portion of that around me; and to me,
High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
Of human cities torture:  I can see
Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be
A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,
Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,
And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain
Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.
LXXIII.
And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:
I look upon the peopled desert Past,
As on a place of agony and strife,
Where, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,
To act and suffer, but remount at last
With a fresh pinion; which I felt to spring,
Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the blast
Which it would cope with, on delighted wing,
Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.
LXXIV.
And when, at length, the mind shall be all free
From what it hates in this degraded form,
Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be
Existent happier in the fly and worm,—
When elements to elements conform,
And dust is as it should be, shall I not
Feel all I see, less dazzling, but more warm?
The bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?
Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?
LXXV.
Are not the mountains, waves, and skies a part
Of me and of my soul, as I of them?
Is not the love of these deep in my heart
With a pure passion? should I not contemn
All objects, if compared with these? and stem
A tide of suffering, rather than forego
Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm
Of those whose eyes are only turned below,
Gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?
LXXVI.
But this is not my theme; and I return
To that which is immediate, and require
Those who find contemplation in the urn,
To look on One whose dust was once all fire,
A native of the land where I respire
The clear air for awhile—a passing guest,
Where he became a being,—whose desire
Was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,
The which to gain and keep he sacrificed all rest.
LXXVII.
Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,
The apostle of affliction, he who threw
Enchantment over passion, and from woe
Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew
The breath which made him wretched; yet he knew
How to make madness beautiful, and cast
O'er erring deeds and thoughts a heavenly hue
Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past
The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.
LXXVIII.
His love was passion's essence—as a tree
On fire by lightning; with ethereal flame
Kindled he was, and blasted; for to be
Thus, and enamoured, were in him the same.
But his was not the love of living dame,
Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,
But of Ideal beauty, which became
In him existence, and o'erflowing teems
Along his burning page, distempered though it seems.
LXXIX.
THIS breathed itself to life in Julie, THIS
Invested her with all that's wild and sweet;
This hallowed, too, the memorable kiss
Which every morn his fevered lip would greet,
From hers, who but with friendship his would meet:
But to that gentle touch, through brain and breast
Flashed the thrilled spirit's love-devouring heat;
In that absorbing sigh perchance more blest,
Than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.
LXXX.
His life was one long war with self-sought foes,
Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind
Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose
For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,
'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
But he was frenzied,—wherefore, who may know?
Since cause might be which skill could never find;
But he was frenzied by disease or woe
To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.
LXXXI.
For then he was inspired, and from him came,
As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,
Those oracles which set the world in flame,
Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:
Did he not this for France, which lay before
Bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?
Broken and trembling to the yoke she bore,
Till by the voice of him and his compeers
Roused up to too much wrath, which follows o'ergrown fears?
LXXXII.
They made themselves a fearful monument!
The wreck of old opinions—things which grew,
Breathed from the birth of time:  the veil they rent,
And what behind it lay, all earth shall view.
But good with ill they also overthrew,
Leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild
Upon the same foundation, and renew
Dungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,
As heretofore, because ambition was self-willed.
LXXXIII.
But this will not endure, nor be endured!
Mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.
They might have used it better, but, allured
By their new vigour, sternly have they dealt
On one another; Pity ceased to melt
With her once natural charities.  But they,
Who in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,
They were not eagles, nourished with the day;
What marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?
LXXXIV.
What deep wounds ever closed without a scar?
The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear
That which disfigures it; and they who war
With their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear
Silence, but not submission:  in his lair
Fixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour
Which shall atone for years; none need despair:
It came, it cometh, and will come,—the power
To punish or forgive—in ONE we shall be slower.
LXXXV.
Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,
With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing
Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake
Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.
This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing
To waft me from distraction; once I loved
Torn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring
Sounds sweet as if a sister's voice reproved,
That I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.
LXXXVI.
It is the hush of night, and all between
Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,
Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen.
Save darkened Jura, whose capt heights appear
Precipitously steep; and drawing near,
There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,
Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,
Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more;
LXXXVII.
He is an evening reveller, who makes
His life an infancy, and sings his fill;
At intervals, some bird from out the brakes
Starts into voice a moment, then is still.
There seems a floating whisper on the hill,
But that is fancy, for the starlight dews
All silently their tears of love instil,
Weeping themselves away, till they infuse
Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.
LXXXVIII.
Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven,
If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
Of men and empires,—'tis to be forgiven,
That in our aspirations to be great,
Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,
And claim a kindred with you; for ye are
A beauty and a mystery, and create
In us such love and reverence from afar,
That fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a star.
LXXXIX.
All heaven and earth are still—though not in sleep,
But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep: —
All heaven and earth are still:  from the high host
Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,
All is concentered in a life intense,
Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
But hath a part of being, and a sense
Of that which is of all Creator and defence.
XC.
Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt
In solitude, where we are LEAST alone;
A truth, which through our being then doth melt,
And purifies from self:  it is a tone,
The soul and source of music, which makes known
Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm,
Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,
Binding all things with beauty;—'twould disarm
The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.
XCI.
Nor vainly did the early Persian make
His altar the high places and the peak
Of earth-o'ergazing mountains, and thus take
A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,
Upreared of human hands.  Come, and compare
Columns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,
With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,
Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!
XCII.
The sky is changed!—and such a change!  O night,
And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,
Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
Of a dark eye in woman!  Far along,
From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,
Leaps the live thunder!  Not from one lone cloud,
But every mountain now hath found a tongue;
And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,
Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!
XCIII.
And this is in the night:—Most glorious night!
Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be
A sharer in thy fierce and far delight—
A portion of the tempest and of thee!
How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,
And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!
And now again 'tis black,—and now, the glee
Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,
As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.
XCIV.
Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between
Heights which appear as lovers who have parted
In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,
That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;
Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,
Love was the very root of the fond rage
Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:
Itself expired, but leaving them an age
Of years all winters—war within themselves to wage.
XCV.
Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,
The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand;
For here, not one, but many, make their play,
And fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,
Flashing and cast around:  of all the band,
The brightest through these parted hills hath forked
His lightnings, as if he did understand
That in such gaps as desolation worked,
There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.
XCVI.
Sky, mountains, river, winds, lake, lightnings! ye,
With night, and clouds, and thunder, and a soul
To make these felt and feeling, well may be
Things that have made me watchful; the far roll
Of your departing voices, is the knoll
Of what in me is sleepless,—if I rest.
But where of ye, O tempests! is the goal?
Are ye like those within the human breast?
Or do ye find at length, like eagles, some high nest?
XCVII.
Could I embody and unbosom now
That which is most within me,—could I wreak
My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw
Soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,
All that I would have sought, and all I seek,
Bear, know, feel, and yet breathe—into one word,
And that one word were lightning, I would speak;
But as it is, I live and die unheard,
With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.
XCVIII.
The morn is up again, the dewy morn,
With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,
Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,
And living as if earth contained no tomb,—
And glowing into day:  we may resume
The march of our existence:  and thus I,
Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room
And food for meditation, nor pass by
Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.
XCIX.
Clarens! sweet Clarens! birthplace of deep Love!
Thine air is the young breath of passionate thought;
Thy trees take root in love; the snows above
The very glaciers have his colours caught,
And sunset into rose-hues sees them wrought
By rays which sleep there lovingly:  the rocks,
The permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought
In them a refuge from the worldly shocks,
Which stir and sting the soul with hope that woos, then mocks.
C.
Clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,—
Undying Love's, who here ascends a throne
To which the steps are mountains; where the god
Is a pervading life and light,—so shown
Not on those summits solely, nor alone
In the still cave and forest; o'er the flower
His eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,
His soft and summer breath, whose tender power
Passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.
CI.
All things are here of HIM; from the black pines,
Which are his shade on high, and the loud roar
Of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines
Which slope his green path downward to the shore,
Where the bowed waters meet him, and adore,
Kissing his feet with murmurs; and the wood,
The covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,
But light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,
Offering to him, and his, a populous solitude.
CII.
A populous solitude of bees and birds,
And fairy-formed and many coloured things,
Who worship him with notes more sweet than words,
And innocently open their glad wings,
Fearless and full of life:  the gush of springs,
And fall of lofty fountains, and the bend
Of stirring branches, and the bud which brings
The swiftest thought of beauty, here extend,
Mingling, and made by Love, unto one mighty end.
CIII.
He who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,
And make his heart a spirit:  he who knows
That tender mystery, will love the more,
For this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,
And the world's waste, have driven him far from those,
For 'tis his nature to advance or die;
He stands not still, but or decays, or grows
Into a boundless blessing, which may vie
With the immortal lights, in its eternity!
CIV.
'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,
Peopling it with affections; but he found
It was the scene which passion must allot
To the mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground
Where early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,
And hallowed it with loveliness:  'tis lone,
And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,
And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone
Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.
CV.
Lausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes
Of names which unto you bequeathed a name;
Mortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,
A path to perpetuity of fame:
They were gigantic minds, and their steep aim
Was, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile
Thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame
Of Heaven, again assailed, if Heaven the while
On man and man's research could deign do more than smile.
CVI.
The one was fire and fickleness, a child
Most mutable in wishes, but in mind
A wit as various,—gay, grave, sage, or wild,—
Historian, bard, philosopher combined:
He multiplied himself among mankind,
The Proteus of their talents:  But his own
Breathed most in ridicule,—which, as the wind,
Blew where it listed, laying all things prone,—
Now to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.
CVII.
The other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,
And hiving wisdom with each studious year,
In meditation dwelt, with learning wrought,
And shaped his weapon with an edge severe,
Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;
The lord of irony,—that master spell,
Which stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear,
And doomed him to the zealot's ready hell,
Which answers to all doubts so eloquently well.
CVIII.
Yet, peace be with their ashes,—for by them,
If merited, the penalty is paid;
It is not ours to judge, far less condemn;
The hour must come when such things shall be made
Known unto all,—or hope and dread allayed
By slumber on one pillow, in the dust,
Which, thus much we are sure, must lie decayed;
And when it shall revive, as is our trust,
'Twill be to be forgiven, or suffer what is just.
CIX.
But let me quit man's works, again to read
His Maker's spread around me, and suspend
This page, which from my reveries I feed,
Until it seems prolonging without end.
The clouds above me to the white Alps tend,
And I must pierce them, and survey whate'er
May be permitted, as my steps I bend
To their most great and growing region, where
The earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.
CX.
Italia! too, Italia! looking on thee
Full flashes on the soul the light of ages,
Since the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,
To the last halo of the chiefs and sages
Who glorify thy consecrated pages;
Thou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,
The fount at which the panting mind assuages
Her thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill,
Flows from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.
CXI.
Thus far have I proceeded in a theme
Renewed with no kind auspices:—to feel
We are not what we have been, and to deem
We are not what we should be, and to steel
The heart against itself; and to conceal,
With a proud caution, love or hate, or aught,—
Passion or feeling, purpose, grief, or zeal,—
Which is the tyrant spirit of our thought,
Is a stern task of soul:—No matter,—it is taught.
CXII.
And for these words, thus woven into song,
It may be that they are a harmless wile,—
The colouring of the scenes which fleet along,
Which I would seize, in passing, to beguile
My breast, or that of others, for a while.
Fame is the thirst of youth,—but I am not
So young as to regard men's frown or smile
As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;
I stood and stand alone,—remembered or forgot.
CXIII.
I have not loved the world, nor the world me;
I have not flattered its rank breath, nor bowed
To its idolatries a patient knee,—
Nor coined my cheek to smiles, nor cried aloud
In worship of an echo; in the crowd
They could not deem me one of such; I stood
Among them, but not of them; in a shroud
Of thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,
Had I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.
CXIV.
I have not loved the world, nor the world me,—
But let us part fair foes; I do believe,
Though I have found them not, that there may be
Words which are things,—hopes which will not deceive,
And virtues which are merciful, nor weave
Snares for the falling:  I would also deem
O'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve;
That two, or one, are almost what they seem,—
That goodness is no name, and happiness no dream.
CXV.
My daughter! with thy name this song begun—
My daughter! with thy name this much shall end—
I see thee not, I hear thee not,—but none
Can be so wrapt in thee; thou art the friend
To whom the shadows of far years extend:
Albeit my brow thou never shouldst behold,
My voice shall with thy future visions blend,
And reach into thy heart, when mine is cold,—
A token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.
CXVI.
To aid thy mind's development,—to watch
Thy dawn of little joys,—to sit and see
Almost thy very growth,—to view thee catch
Knowledge of objects, wonders yet to thee!
To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,
And print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,—
This, it should seem, was not reserved for me
Yet this was in my nature:—As it is,
I know not what is there, yet something like to this.
CXVII.
Yet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,
I know that thou wilt love me; though my name
Should be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught
With desolation, and a broken claim:
Though the grave closed between us,—'twere the same,
I know that thou wilt love me:  though to drain
MY blood from out thy being were an aim,
And an attainment,—all would be in vain,—
Still thou wouldst love me, still that more than life retain.
CXVIII.
The child of love,—though born in bitterness,
And nurtured in convulsion.  Of thy sire
These were the elements, and thine no less.
As yet such are around thee; but thy fire
Shall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher.
Sweet be thy cradled slumbers!  O'er the sea,
And from the mountains where I now respire,
Fain would I waft such blessing upon thee,
As, with a sigh, I deem thou mightst have been to me!


CANTO THE FOURTH.
I.
I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;
A palace and a prison on each hand:
I saw from out the wave her structures rise
As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:
A thousand years their cloudy wings expand
Around me, and a dying glory smiles
O'er the far times when many a subject land
Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,
Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!
II.
She looks a sea Cybele, fresh from ocean,
Rising with her tiara of proud towers
At airy distance, with majestic motion,
A ruler of the waters and their powers:
And such she was; her daughters had their dowers
From spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East
Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.
In purple was she robed, and of her feast
Monarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased.
III.
In Venice, Tasso's echoes are no more,
And silent rows the songless gondolier;
Her palaces are crumbling to the shore,
And music meets not always now the ear:
Those days are gone—but beauty still is here.
States fall, arts fade—but Nature doth not die,
Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,
The pleasant place of all festivity,
The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy!
IV.
But unto us she hath a spell beyond
Her name in story, and her long array
Of mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond
Above the dogeless city's vanished sway;
Ours is a trophy which will not decay
With the Rialto; Shylock and the Moor,
And Pierre, cannot be swept or worn away—
The keystones of the arch! though all were o'er,
For us repeopled were the solitary shore.
V.
The beings of the mind are not of clay;
Essentially immortal, they create
And multiply in us a brighter ray
And more beloved existence:  that which Fate
Prohibits to dull life, in this our state
Of mortal bondage, by these spirits supplied,
First exiles, then replaces what we hate;
Watering the heart whose early flowers have died,
And with a fresher growth replenishing the void.
VI.
Such is the refuge of our youth and age,
The first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;
And this worn feeling peoples many a page,
And, may be, that which grows beneath mine eye:
Yet there are things whose strong reality
Outshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues
More beautiful than our fantastic sky,
And the strange constellations which the Muse
O'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:
VII.
I saw or dreamed of such,—but let them go—
They came like truth, and disappeared like dreams;
And whatsoe'er they were—are now but so;
I could replace them if I would:  still teems
My mind with many a form which aptly seems
Such as I sought for, and at moments found;
Let these too go—for waking reason deems
Such overweening phantasies unsound,
And other voices speak, and other sights surround.
VIII.
I've taught me other tongues, and in strange eyes
Have made me not a stranger; to the mind
Which is itself, no changes bring surprise;
Nor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find
A country with—ay, or without mankind;
Yet was I born where men are proud to be,
Not without cause; and should I leave behind
The inviolate island of the sage and free,
And seek me out a home by a remoter sea,
IX.
Perhaps I loved it well:  and should I lay
My ashes in a soil which is not mine,
My spirit shall resume it—if we may
Unbodied choose a sanctuary.  I twine
My hopes of being remembered in my line
With my land's language:  if too fond and far
These aspirations in their scope incline,—
If my fame should be, as my fortunes are,
Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar.
X.
My name from out the temple where the dead
Are honoured by the nations—let it be—
And light the laurels on a loftier head!
And be the Spartan's epitaph on me—
'Sparta hath many a worthier son than he.'
Meantime I seek no sympathies, nor need;
The thorns which I have reaped are of the tree
I planted,—they have torn me, and I bleed:
I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.
XI.
The spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord;
And, annual marriage now no more renewed,
The Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,
Neglected garment of her widowhood!
St. Mark yet sees his lion where he stood
Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,
Over the proud place where an Emperor sued,
And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour
When Venice was a queen with an unequalled dower.
XII.
The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns—
An Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;
Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains
Clank over sceptred cities; nations melt
From power's high pinnacle, when they have felt
The sunshine for a while, and downward go
Like lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt:
Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!
The octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.
XIII.
Before St. Mark still glow his steeds of brass,
Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;
But is not Doria's menace come to pass?
Are they not BRIDLED?—Venice, lost and won,
Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,
Sinks, like a seaweed, into whence she rose!
Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,
Even in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,
From whom submission wrings an infamous repose.
XIV.
In youth she was all glory,—a new Tyre,—
Her very byword sprung from victory,
The 'Planter of the Lion,' which through fire
And blood she bore o'er subject earth and sea;
Though making many slaves, herself still free
And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite:
Witness Troy's rival, Candia!  Vouch it, ye
Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!
For ye are names no time nor tyranny can blight.
XV.
Statues of glass—all shivered—the long file
Of her dead doges are declined to dust;
But where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile
Bespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;
Their sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,
Have yielded to the stranger:  empty halls,
Thin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must
Too oft remind her who and what enthrals,
Have flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.
XVI.
When Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,
And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,
Redemption rose up in the Attic Muse,
Her voice their only ransom from afar:
See! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car
Of the o'ermastered victor stops, the reins
Fall from his hands—his idle scimitar
Starts from its belt—he rends his captive's chains,
And bids him thank the bard for freedom and his strains.
XVII.
Thus, Venice, if no stronger claim were thine,
Were all thy proud historic deeds forgot,
Thy choral memory of the bard divine,
Thy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot
Which ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot
Is shameful to the nations,—most of all,
Albion! to thee:  the Ocean Queen should not
Abandon Ocean's children; in the fall
Of Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.
XVIII.
I loved her from my boyhood:  she to me
Was as a fairy city of the heart,
Rising like water-columns from the sea,
Of joy the sojourn, and of wealth the mart
And Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakspeare's art,
Had stamped her image in me, and e'en so,
Although I found her thus, we did not part,
Perchance e'en dearer in her day of woe,
Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.
XIX.
I can repeople with the past—and of
The present there is still for eye and thought,
And meditation chastened down, enough;
And more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;
And of the happiest moments which were wrought
Within the web of my existence, some
From thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:
There are some feelings Time cannot benumb,
Nor torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.
XX.
But from their nature will the tannen grow
Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,
Rooted in barrenness, where nought below
Of soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks
Of eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks
The howling tempest, till its height and frame
Are worthy of the mountains from whose blocks
Of bleak, grey granite, into life it came,
And grew a giant tree;—the mind may grow the same.
XXI.
Existence may be borne, and the deep root
Of life and sufferance make its firm abode
In bare and desolate bosoms:  mute
The camel labours with the heaviest load,
And the wolf dies in silence.  Not bestowed
In vain should such examples be; if they,
Things of ignoble or of savage mood,
Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay
May temper it to bear,—it is but for a day.
XXII.
All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,
Even by the sufferer; and, in each event,
Ends:—Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,
Return to whence they came—with like intent,
And weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,
Wax grey and ghastly, withering ere their time,
And perish with the reed on which they leant;
Some seek devotion, toil, war, good or crime,
According as their souls were formed to sink or climb.
XXIII.
But ever and anon of griefs subdued
There comes a token like a scorpion's sting,
Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;
And slight withal may be the things which bring
Back on the heart the weight which it would fling
Aside for ever:  it may be a sound—
A tone of music—summer's eve—or spring—
A flower—the wind—the ocean—which shall wound,
Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound.
XXIV.
And how and why we know not, nor can trace
Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,
But feel the shock renewed, nor can efface
The blight and blackening which it leaves behind,
Which out of things familiar, undesigned,
When least we deem of such, calls up to view
The spectres whom no exorcism can bind,—
The cold—the changed—perchance the dead—anew,
The mourned, the loved, the lost—too many!—yet how few!
XXV.
But my soul wanders; I demand it back
To meditate amongst decay, and stand
A ruin amidst ruins; there to track
Fall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land
Which WAS the mightiest in its old command,
And IS the loveliest, and must ever be
The master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand,
Wherein were cast the heroic and the free,
The beautiful, the brave—the lords of earth and sea.
XXVI.
The commonwealth of kings, the men of Rome!
And even since, and now, fair Italy!
Thou art the garden of the world, the home
Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;
Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?
Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste
More rich than other climes' fertility;
Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced
With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.
XXVII.
The moon is up, and yet it is not night—
Sunset divides the sky with her—a sea
Of glory streams along the Alpine height
Of blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free
From clouds, but of all colours seems to be—
Melted to one vast Iris of the West,
Where the day joins the past eternity;
While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest
Floats through the azure air—an island of the blest!
XXVIII.
A single star is at her side, and reigns
With her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still
Yon sunny sea heaves brightly, and remains
Rolled o'er the peak of the far Rhaetian hill,
As Day and Night contending were, until
Nature reclaimed her order:—gently flows
The deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil
The odorous purple of a new-born rose,
Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,
XXIX.
Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,
Comes down upon the waters; all its hues,
From the rich sunset to the rising star,
Their magical variety diffuse:
And now they change; a paler shadow strews
Its mantle o'er the mountains; parting day
Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues
With a new colour as it gasps away,
The last still loveliest, till—'tis gone—and all is grey.
XXX.
There is a tomb in Arqua;—reared in air,
Pillared in their sarcophagus, repose
The bones of Laura's lover:  here repair
Many familiar with his well-sung woes,
The pilgrims of his genius.  He arose
To raise a language, and his land reclaim
From the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:
Watering the tree which bears his lady's name
With his melodious tears, he gave himself to fame.
XXXI.
They keep his dust in Arqua, where he died;
The mountain-village where his latter days
Went down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride—
An honest pride—and let it be their praise,
To offer to the passing stranger's gaze
His mansion and his sepulchre; both plain
And venerably simple, such as raise
A feeling more accordant with his strain,
Than if a pyramid formed his monumental fane.
XXXII.
And the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt
Is one of that complexion which seems made
For those who their mortality have felt,
And sought a refuge from their hopes decayed
In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,
Which shows a distant prospect far away
Of busy cities, now in vain displayed,
For they can lure no further; and the ray
Of a bright sun can make sufficient holiday.
XXXIII.
Developing the mountains, leaves, and flowers
And shining in the brawling brook, where-by,
Clear as its current, glide the sauntering hours
With a calm languor, which, though to the eye
Idlesse it seem, hath its morality,
If from society we learn to live,
'Tis solitude should teach us how to die;
It hath no flatterers; vanity can give
No hollow aid; alone—man with his God must strive:
XXXIV.
Or, it may be, with demons, who impair
The strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey
In melancholy bosoms, such as were
Of moody texture from their earliest day,
And loved to dwell in darkness and dismay,
Deeming themselves predestined to a doom
Which is not of the pangs that pass away;
Making the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,
The tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom.
XXXV.
Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,
Whose symmetry was not for solitude,
There seems as 'twere a curse upon the seat's
Of former sovereigns, and the antique brood
Of Este, which for many an age made good
Its strength within thy walls, and was of yore
Patron or tyrant, as the changing mood
Of petty power impelled, of those who wore
The wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.
XXXVI.
And Tasso is their glory and their shame.
Hark to his strain! and then survey his cell!
And see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,
And where Alfonso bade his poet dwell.
The miserable despot could not quell
The insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend
With the surrounding maniacs, in the hell
Where he had plunged it.  Glory without end
Scattered the clouds away—and on that name attend
XXXVII.
The tears and praises of all time, while thine
Would rot in its oblivion—in the sink
Of worthless dust, which from thy boasted line
Is shaken into nothing; but the link
Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think
Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn—
Alfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink
From thee! if in another station born,
Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn:
XXXVIII.
THOU! formed to eat, and be despised, and die,
Even as the beasts that perish, save that thou
Hadst a more splendid trough, and wider sty:
HE! with a glory round his furrowed brow,
Which emanated then, and dazzles now
In face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,
And Boileau, whose rash envy could allow
No strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,
That whetstone of the teeth—monotony in wire!
XXXIX.
Peace to Torquato's injured shade! 'twas his
In life and death to be the mark where Wrong
Aimed with their poisoned arrows—but to miss.
Oh, victor unsurpassed in modern song!
Each year brings forth its millions; but how long
The tide of generations shall roll on,
And not the whole combined and countless throng
Compose a mind like thine?  Though all in one
Condensed their scattered rays, they would not form a sun.
XL.
Great as thou art, yet paralleled by those
Thy countrymen, before thee born to shine,
The bards of Hell and Chivalry:  first rose
The Tuscan father's comedy divine;
Then, not unequal to the Florentine,
The Southern Scott, the minstrel who called forth
A new creation with his magic line,
And, like the Ariosto of the North,
Sang ladye-love and war, romance and knightly worth.
XLI.
The lightning rent from Ariosto's bust
The iron crown of laurel's mimicked leaves;
Nor was the ominous element unjust,
For the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves
Is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,
And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;
Yet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,
Know that the lightning sanctifies below
Whate'er it strikes;—yon head is doubly sacred now.
XLII.
Italia!  O Italia! thou who hast
The fatal gift of beauty, which became
A funeral dower of present woes and past,
On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,
And annals graved in characters of flame.
Oh God! that thou wert in thy nakedness
Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim
Thy right, and awe the robbers back, who press
To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;
XLIII.
Then mightst thou more appal; or, less desired,
Be homely and be peaceful, undeplored
For thy destructive charms; then, still untired,
Would not be seen the armed torrents poured
Down the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde
Of many-nationed spoilers from the Po
Quaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword
Be thy sad weapon of defence, and so,
Victor or vanquished, thou the slave of friend or foe.
XLIV.
Wandering in youth, I traced the path of him,
The Roman friend of Rome's least mortal mind,
The friend of Tully:  as my bark did skim
The bright blue waters with a fanning wind,
Came Megara before me, and behind
AEgina lay, Piraeus on the right,
And Corinth on the left; I lay reclined
Along the prow, and saw all these unite
In ruin, even as he had seen the desolate sight;
XLV.
For time hath not rebuilt them, but upreared
Barbaric dwellings on their shattered site,
Which only make more mourned and more endeared
The few last rays of their far-scattered light,
And the crushed relics of their vanished might.
The Roman saw these tombs in his own age,
These sepulchres of cities, which excite
Sad wonder, and his yet surviving page
The moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.
XLVI.
That page is now before me, and on mine
HIS country's ruin added to the mass
Of perished states he mourned in their decline,
And I in desolation:  all that WAS
Of then destruction IS; and now, alas!
Rome—Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,
In the same dust and blackness, and we pass
The skeleton of her Titanic form,
Wrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.
XLVII.
Yet, Italy! through every other land
Thy wrongs should ring, and shall, from side to side;
Mother of Arts! as once of Arms; thy hand
Was then our Guardian, and is still our guide;
Parent of our religion! whom the wide
Nations have knelt to for the keys of heaven!
Europe, repentant of her parricide,
Shall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,
Roll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.
XLVIII.
But Arno wins us to the fair white walls,
Where the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps
A softer feeling for her fairy halls.
Girt by her theatre of hills, she reaps
Her corn, and wine, and oil, and Plenty leaps
To laughing life, with her redundant horn.
Along the banks where smiling Arno sweeps,
Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,
And buried Learning rose, redeemed to a new morn.
XLIX.
There, too, the goddess loves in stone, and fills
The air around with beauty; we inhale
The ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils
Part of its immortality; the veil
Of heaven is half undrawn; within the pale
We stand, and in that form and face behold
What Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;
And to the fond idolaters of old
Envy the innate flash which such a soul could mould:
L.
We gaze and turn away, and know not where,
Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart
Reels with its fulness; there—for ever there—
Chained to the chariot of triumphal Art,
We stand as captives, and would not depart.
Away!—there need no words, nor terms precise,
The paltry jargon of the marble mart,
Where Pedantry gulls Folly—we have eyes:
Blood, pulse, and breast, confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.
LI.
Appearedst thou not to Paris in this guise?
Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,
In all thy perfect goddess-ship, when lies
Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?
And gazing in thy face as toward a star,
Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,
Feeding on thy sweet cheek! while thy lips are
With lava kisses melting while they burn,
Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!
LII.
Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love,
Their full divinity inadequate
That feeling to express, or to improve,
The gods become as mortals, and man's fate
Has moments like their brightest! but the weight
Of earth recoils upon us;—let it go!
We can recall such visions, and create
From what has been, or might be, things which grow,
Into thy statue's form, and look like gods below.
LIII.
I leave to learned fingers, and wise hands,
The artist and his ape, to teach and tell
How well his connoisseurship understands
The graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:
Let these describe the undescribable:
I would not their vile breath should crisp the stream
Wherein that image shall for ever dwell;
The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream
That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.
LIV.
In Santa Croce's holy precincts lie
Ashes which make it holier, dust which is
E'en in itself an immortality,
Though there were nothing save the past, and this
The particle of those sublimities
Which have relapsed to chaos:—here repose
Angelo's, Alfieri's bones, and his,
The starry Galileo, with his woes;
Here Machiavelli's earth returned to whence it rose.
LV.
These are four minds, which, like the elements,
Might furnish forth creation:—Italy!
Time, which hath wronged thee with ten thousand rents
Of thine imperial garment, shall deny,
And hath denied, to every other sky,
Spirits which soar from ruin:—thy decay
Is still impregnate with divinity,
Which gilds it with revivifying ray;
Such as the great of yore, Canova is to-day.
LVI.
But where repose the all Etruscan three—
Dante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less than they,
The Bard of Prose, creative spirit! he
Of the Hundred Tales of love—where did they lay
Their bones, distinguished from our common clay
In death as life?  Are they resolved to dust,
And have their country's marbles nought to say?
Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?
Did they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?
LVII.
Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,
Like Scipio, buried by the upbraiding shore;
Thy factions, in their worse than civil war,
Proscribed the bard whose name for evermore
Their children's children would in vain adore
With the remorse of ages; and the crown
Which Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,
Upon a far and foreign soil had grown,
His life, his fame, his grave, though rifled—not thine own.
LVIII.
Boccaccio to his parent earth bequeathed
His dust,—and lies it not her great among,
With many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed
O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?
That music in itself, whose sounds are song,
The poetry of speech?  No;—even his tomb
Uptorn, must bear the hyaena bigots' wrong,
No more amidst the meaner dead find room,
Nor claim a passing sigh, because it told for WHOM?
LIX.
And Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;
Yet for this want more noted, as of yore
The Caesar's pageant, shorn of Brutus' bust,
Did but of Rome's best son remind her more:
Happier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,
Fortress of falling empire! honoured sleeps
The immortal exile;—Arqua, too, her store
Of tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,
While Florence vainly begs her banished dead, and weeps.
LX.
What is her pyramid of precious stones?
Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues
Of gem and marble, to encrust the bones
Of merchant-dukes? the momentary dews
Which, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse
Freshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,
Whose names are mausoleums of the Muse,
Are gently prest with far more reverent tread
Than ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.
LXI.
There be more things to greet the heart and eyes
In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,
Where Sculpture with her rainbow sister vies;
There be more marvels yet—but not for mine;
For I have been accustomed to entwine
My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields
Than Art in galleries:  though a work divine
Calls for my spirit's homage, yet it yields
Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields
LXII.
Is of another temper, and I roam
By Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles
Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;
For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles
Come back before me, as his skill beguiles
The host between the mountains and the shore,
Where Courage falls in her despairing files,
And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,
Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er,
LXIII.
Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;
And such the storm of battle on this day,
And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
To all save carnage, that, beneath the fray,
An earthquake reeled unheededly away!
None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,
And yawning forth a grave for those who lay
Upon their bucklers for a winding-sheet;
Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet.
LXIV.
The Earth to them was as a rolling bark
Which bore them to Eternity; they saw
The Ocean round, but had no time to mark
The motions of their vessel:  Nature's law,
In them suspended, recked not of the awe
Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds
Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw
From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
Stumble o'er heaving plains, and man's dread hath no words.
LXV.
Far other scene is Thrasimene now;
Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain
Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;
Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain
Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en—
A little rill of scanty stream and bed—
A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;
And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead
Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red.
LXVI.
But thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave
Of the most living crystal that was e'er
The haunt of river nymph, to gaze and lave
Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear
Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer
Grazes; the purest god of gentle waters!
And most serene of aspect, and most clear:
Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters,
A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!
LXVII.
And on thy happy shore a temple still,
Of small and delicate proportion, keeps,
Upon a mild declivity of hill,
Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps
Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps
The finny darter with the glittering scales,
Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;
While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails
Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.
LXVIII.
Pass not unblest the genius of the place!
If through the air a zephyr more serene
Win to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace
Along his margin a more eloquent green,
If on the heart the freshness of the scene
Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust
Of weary life a moment lave it clean
With Nature's baptism,—'tis to him ye must
Pay orisons for this suspension of disgust.
LXIX.
The roar of waters!—from the headlong height
Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
The fall of waters! rapid as the light
The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;
The hell of waters! where they howl and hiss,
And boil in endless torture; while the sweat
Of their great agony, wrung out from this
Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet
That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,
LXX.
And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again
Returns in an unceasing shower, which round,
With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,
Is an eternal April to the ground,
Making it all one emerald.  How profound
The gulf! and how the giant element
From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,
Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent
With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent
LXXI.
To the broad column which rolls on, and shows
More like the fountain of an infant sea
Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes
Of a new world, than only thus to be
Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,
With many windings through the vale:—Look back!
Lo! where it comes like an eternity,
As if to sweep down all things in its track,
Charming the eye with dread,—a matchless cataract,
LXXII.
Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,
From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,
An Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,
Like Hope upon a deathbed, and, unworn
Its steady dyes, while all around is torn
By the distracted waters, bears serene
Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
Resembling, mid the torture of the scene,
Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.
LXXIII.
Once more upon the woody Apennine,
The infant Alps, which—had I not before
Gazed on their mightier parents, where the pine
Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar
The thundering lauwine—might be worshipped more;
But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear
Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar
Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near,
And in Chimari heard the thunder-hills of fear,
LXXIV.
The Acroceraunian mountains of old name;
And on Parnassus seen the eagles fly
Like spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame,
For still they soared unutterably high:
I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;
Athos, Olympus, AEtna, Atlas, made
These hills seem things of lesser dignity,
All, save the lone Soracte's height displayed,
Not NOW in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid
LXXV.
For our remembrance, and from out the plain
Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break,
And on the curl hangs pausing:  not in vain
May he who will his recollections rake,
And quote in classic raptures, and awake
The hills with Latian echoes; I abhorred
Too much, to conquer for the poet's sake,
The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word
In my repugnant youth, with pleasure to record
LXXVI.
Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned
My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught
My mind to meditate what then it learned,
Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought
By the impatience of my early thought,
That, with the freshness wearing out before
My mind could relish what it might have sought,
If free to choose, I cannot now restore
Its health; but what it then detested, still abhor.
LXXVII.
Then farewell, Horace; whom I hated so,
Not for thy faults, but mine; it is a curse
To understand, not feel, thy lyric flow,
To comprehend, but never love thy verse,
Although no deeper moralist rehearse
Our little life, nor bard prescribe his art,
Nor livelier satirist the conscience pierce,
Awakening without wounding the touched heart,
Yet fare thee well—upon Soracte's ridge we part.
LXXVIII.
O Rome! my country! city of the soul!
The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,
Lone mother of dead empires! and control
In their shut breasts their petty misery.
What are our woes and sufferance?  Come and see
The cypress, hear the owl, and plod your way
O'er steps of broken thrones and temples, Ye!
Whose agonies are evils of a day—
A world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.
LXXIX.
The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;
An empty urn within her withered hands,
Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;
The very sepulchres lie tenantless
Of their heroic dwellers:  dost thou flow,
Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
Rise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress!
LXXX.
The Goth, the Christian, Time, War, Flood, and Fire,
Have dwelt upon the seven-hilled city's pride:
She saw her glories star by star expire,
And up the steep barbarian monarchs ride,
Where the car climbed the Capitol; far and wide
Temple and tower went down, nor left a site;—
Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,
O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
And say, 'Here was, or is,' where all is doubly night?
LXXXI.
The double night of ages, and of her,
Night's daughter, Ignorance, hath wrapt, and wrap
All round us; we but feel our way to err:
The ocean hath its chart, the stars their map;
And knowledge spreads them on her ample lap;
But Rome is as the desert, where we steer
Stumbling o'er recollections:  now we clap
Our hands, and cry, 'Eureka!' it is clear—
When but some false mirage of ruin rises near.
LXXXII.
Alas, the lofty city! and alas
The trebly hundred triumphs! and the day
When Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass
The conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!
Alas for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,
And Livy's pictured page!  But these shall be
Her resurrection; all beside—decay.
Alas for Earth, for never shall we see
That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free!
LXXXIII.
O thou, whose chariot rolled on Fortune's wheel,
Triumphant Sylla!  Thou, who didst subdue
Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel
The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due
Of hoarded vengeance till thine eagles flew
O'er prostrate Asia;—thou, who with thy frown
Annihilated senates—Roman, too,
With all thy vices, for thou didst lay down
With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown—
LXXXIV.
The dictatorial wreath,—couldst thou divine
To what would one day dwindle that which made
Thee more than mortal? and that so supine
By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?
She who was named eternal, and arrayed
Her warriors but to conquer—she who veiled
Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed
Until the o'er-canopied horizon failed,
Her rushing wings—Oh! she who was almighty hailed!
LXXXV.
Sylla was first of victors; but our own,
The sagest of usurpers, Cromwell!—he
Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne
Down to a block—immortal rebel!  See
What crimes it costs to be a moment free
And famous through all ages!  But beneath
His fate the moral lurks of destiny;
His day of double victory and death
Beheld him win two realms, and, happier, yield his breath.
LXXXVI.
The third of the same moon whose former course
Had all but crowned him, on the self-same day
Deposed him gently from his throne of force,
And laid him with the earth's preceding clay.
And showed not Fortune thus how fame and sway,
And all we deem delightful, and consume
Our souls to compass through each arduous way,
Are in her eyes less happy than the tomb?
Were they but so in man's, how different were his doom!
LXXXVII.
And thou, dread statue! yet existent in
The austerest form of naked majesty,
Thou who beheldest, mid the assassins' din,
At thy bathed base the bloody Caesar lie,
Folding his robe in dying dignity,
An offering to thine altar from the queen
Of gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,
And thou, too, perish, Pompey? have ye been
Victors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?
LXXXVIII.
And thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome!
She-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart
The milk of conquest yet within the dome
Where, as a monument of antique art,
Thou standest:—Mother of the mighty heart,
Which the great founder sucked from thy wild teat,
Scorched by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,
And thy limbs blacked with lightning—dost thou yet
Guard thine immortal cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?
LXXXIX.
Thou dost;—but all thy foster-babes are dead—
The men of iron; and the world hath reared
Cities from out their sepulchres:  men bled
In imitation of the things they feared,
And fought and conquered, and the same course steered,
At apish distance; but as yet none have,
Nor could, the same supremacy have neared,
Save one vain man, who is not in the grave,
But, vanquished by himself, to his own slaves a slave,
XC.
The fool of false dominion—and a kind
Of bastard Caesar, following him of old
With steps unequal; for the Roman's mind
Was modelled in a less terrestrial mould,
With passions fiercer, yet a judgment cold,
And an immortal instinct which redeemed
The frailties of a heart so soft, yet bold.
Alcides with the distaff now he seemed
At Cleopatra's feet, and now himself he beamed.
XCI.
And came, and saw, and conquered.  But the man
Who would have tamed his eagles down to flee,
Like a trained falcon, in the Gallic van,
Which he, in sooth, long led to victory,
With a deaf heart which never seemed to be
A listener to itself, was strangely framed;
With but one weakest weakness—vanity:
Coquettish in ambition, still he aimed
At what?  Can he avouch, or answer what he claimed?
XCII.
And would be all or nothing—nor could wait
For the sure grave to level him; few years
Had fixed him with the Caesars in his fate,
On whom we tread:  For THIS the conqueror rears
The arch of triumph! and for this the tears
And blood of earth flow on as they have flowed,
An universal deluge, which appears
Without an ark for wretched man's abode,
And ebbs but to reflow!—Renew thy rainbow, God!
XCIII.
What from this barren being do we reap?
Our senses narrow, and our reason frail,
Life short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,
And all things weighed in custom's falsest scale;
Opinion an omnipotence, whose veil
Mantles the earth with darkness, until right
And wrong are accidents, and men grow pale
Lest their own judgments should become too bright,
And their free thoughts be crimes, and earth have too much light.
XCIV.
And thus they plod in sluggish misery,
Rotting from sire to son, and age to age,
Proud of their trampled nature, and so die,
Bequeathing their hereditary rage
To the new race of inborn slaves, who wage
War for their chains, and rather than be free,
Bleed gladiator-like, and still engage
Within the same arena where they see
Their fellows fall before, like leaves of the same tree.
XCV.
I speak not of men's creeds—they rest between
Man and his Maker—but of things allowed,
Averred, and known,—and daily, hourly seen—
The yoke that is upon us doubly bowed,
And the intent of tyranny avowed,
The edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown
The apes of him who humbled once the proud,
And shook them from their slumbers on the throne;
Too glorious, were this all his mighty arm had done.
XCVI.
Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,
And Freedom find no champion and no child
Such as Columbia saw arise when she
Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?
Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,
Deep in the unpruned forest, midst the roar
Of cataracts, where nursing nature smiled
On infant Washington?  Has Earth no more
Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?
XCVII.
But France got drunk with blood to vomit crime,
And fatal have her Saturnalia been
To Freedom's cause, in every age and clime;
Because the deadly days which we have seen,
And vile Ambition, that built up between
Man and his hopes an adamantine wall,
And the base pageant last upon the scene,
Are grown the pretext for the eternal thrall
Which nips Life's tree, and dooms man's worst—his second fall.
XCVIII.
Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,
Streams like the thunder-storm AGAINST the wind;
Thy trumpet-voice, though broken now and dying,
The loudest still the tempest leaves behind;
Thy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,
Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth,
But the sap lasts,—and still the seed we find
Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North;
So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.
XCIX.
There is a stern round tower of other days,
Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,
Such as an army's baffled strength delays,
Standing with half its battlements alone,
And with two thousand years of ivy grown,
The garland of eternity, where wave
The green leaves over all by time o'erthrown:
What was this tower of strength? within its cave
What treasure lay so locked, so hid?—A woman's grave.
C.
But who was she, the lady of the dead,
Tombed in a palace?  Was she chaste and fair?
Worthy a king's—or more—a Roman's bed?
What race of chiefs and heroes did she bear?
What daughter of her beauties was the heir?
How lived—how loved—how died she?  Was she not
So honoured—and conspicuously there,
Where meaner relics must not dare to rot,
Placed to commemorate a more than mortal lot?
CI.
Was she as those who love their lords, or they
Who love the lords of others? such have been
Even in the olden time, Rome's annals say.
Was she a matron of Cornelia's mien,
Or the light air of Egypt's graceful queen,
Profuse of joy; or 'gainst it did she war,
Inveterate in virtue?  Did she lean
To the soft side of the heart, or wisely bar
Love from amongst her griefs?—for such the affections are.
CII.
Perchance she died in youth:  it may be, bowed
With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb
That weighed upon her gentle dust, a cloud
Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom
In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom
Heaven gives its favourites—early death; yet shed
A sunset charm around her, and illume
With hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,
Of her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.
CIII.
Perchance she died in age—surviving all,
Charms, kindred, children—with the silver grey
On her long tresses, which might yet recall,
It may be, still a something of the day
When they were braided, and her proud array
And lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed
By Rome—But whither would Conjecture stray?
Thus much alone we know—Metella died,
The wealthiest Roman's wife:  Behold his love or pride!
CIV.
I know not why—but standing thus by thee
It seems as if I had thine inmate known,
Thou Tomb! and other days come back on me
With recollected music, though the tone
Is changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan
Of dying thunder on the distant wind;
Yet could I seat me by this ivied stone
Till I had bodied forth the heated mind,
Forms from the floating wreck which ruin leaves behind;
CV.
And from the planks, far shattered o'er the rocks,
Built me a little bark of hope, once more
To battle with the ocean and the shocks
Of the loud breakers, and the ceaseless roar
Which rushes on the solitary shore
Where all lies foundered that was ever dear:
But could I gather from the wave-worn store
Enough for my rude boat, where should I steer?
There woos no home, nor hope, nor life, save what is here.
CVI.
Then let the winds howl on! their harmony
Shall henceforth be my music, and the night
The sound shall temper with the owlet's cry,
As I now hear them, in the fading light
Dim o'er the bird of darkness' native site,
Answer each other on the Palatine,
With their large eyes, all glistening grey and bright,
And sailing pinions.—Upon such a shrine
What are our petty griefs?—let me not number mine.
CVII.
Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown
Matted and massed together, hillocks heaped
On what were chambers, arch crushed, column strown
In fragments, choked-up vaults, and frescoes steeped
In subterranean damps, where the owl peeped,
Deeming it midnight:—Temples, baths, or halls?
Pronounce who can; for all that Learning reaped
From her research hath been, that these are walls—
Behold the Imperial Mount! 'tis thus the mighty falls.
CVIII.
There is the moral of all human tales:
'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,
First Freedom, and then Glory—when that fails,
Wealth, vice, corruption—barbarism at last.
And History, with all her volumes vast,
Hath but ONE page,—'tis better written here,
Where gorgeous Tyranny hath thus amassed
All treasures, all delights, that eye or ear,
Heart, soul could seek, tongue ask—Away with words! draw near,
CIX.
Admire, exult—despise—laugh, weep—for here
There is such matter for all feeling:—Man!
Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,
Ages and realms are crowded in this span,
This mountain, whose obliterated plan
The pyramid of empires pinnacled,
Of Glory's gewgaws shining in the van
Till the sun's rays with added flame were filled!
Where are its golden roofs? where those who dared to build?
CX.
Tully was not so eloquent as thou,
Thou nameless column with the buried base!
What are the laurels of the Caesar's brow?
Crown me with ivy from his dwelling-place.
Whose arch or pillar meets me in the face,
Titus or Trajan's?  No; 'tis that of Time:
Triumph, arch, pillar, all he doth displace,
Scoffing; and apostolic statues climb
To crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime,
CXI.
Buried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome,
And looking to the stars; they had contained
A spirit which with these would find a home,
The last of those who o'er the whole earth reigned,
The Roman globe, for after none sustained
But yielded back his conquests:—he was more
Than a mere Alexander, and unstained
With household blood and wine, serenely wore
His sovereign virtues—still we Trajan's name adore.
CXII.
Where is the rock of Triumph, the high place
Where Rome embraced her heroes? where the steep
Tarpeian—fittest goal of Treason's race,
The promontory whence the traitor's leap
Cured all ambition?  Did the Conquerors heap
Their spoils here?  Yes; and in yon field below,
A thousand years of silenced factions sleep—
The Forum, where the immortal accents glow,
And still the eloquent air breathes—burns with Cicero!
CXIII.
The field of freedom, faction, fame, and blood:
Here a proud people's passions were exhaled,
From the first hour of empire in the bud
To that when further worlds to conquer failed;
But long before had Freedom's face been veiled,
And Anarchy assumed her attributes:
Till every lawless soldier who assailed
Trod on the trembling Senate's slavish mutes,
Or raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.
CXIV.
Then turn we to our latest tribune's name,
From her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,
Redeemer of dark centuries of shame—
The friend of Petrarch—hope of Italy—
Rienzi! last of Romans!  While the tree
Of freedom's withered trunk puts forth a leaf,
Even for thy tomb a garland let it be—
The forum's champion, and the people's chief—
Her new-born Numa thou, with reign, alas! too brief.
CXV.
Egeria! sweet creation of some heart
Which found no mortal resting-place so fair
As thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art
Or wert,—a young Aurora of the air,
The nympholepsy of some fond despair;
Or, it might be, a beauty of the earth,
Who found a more than common votary there
Too much adoring; whatsoe'er thy birth,
Thou wert a beautiful thought, and softly bodied forth.
CXVI.
The mosses of thy fountain still are sprinkled
With thine Elysian water-drops; the face
Of thy cave-guarded spring, with years unwrinkled,
Reflects the meek-eyed genius of the place,
Whose green wild margin now no more erase
Art's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep,
Prisoned in marble, bubbling from the base
Of the cleft statue, with a gentle leap
The rill runs o'er, and round, fern, flowers, and ivy creep,
CXVII.
Fantastically tangled; the green hills
Are clothed with early blossoms, through the grass
The quick-eyed lizard rustles, and the bills
Of summer birds sing welcome as ye pass;
Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,
Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes
Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;
The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes,
Kissed by the breath of heaven, seems coloured by its skies.
CXVIII.
Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,
Egeria! thy all heavenly bosom beating
For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;
The purple Midnight veiled that mystic meeting
With her most starry canopy, and seating
Thyself by thine adorer, what befell?
This cave was surely shaped out for the greeting
Of an enamoured Goddess, and the cell
Haunted by holy Love—the earliest oracle!
CXIX.
And didst thou not, thy breast to his replying,
Blend a celestial with a human heart;
And Love, which dies as it was born, in sighing,
Share with immortal transports? could thine art
Make them indeed immortal, and impart
The purity of heaven to earthly joys,
Expel the venom and not blunt the dart—
The dull satiety which all destroys—
And root from out the soul the deadly weed which cloys?
CXX.
Alas! our young affections run to waste,
Or water but the desert:  whence arise
But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,
Rank at the core, though tempting to the eyes,
Flowers whose wild odours breathe but agonies,
And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants
Which spring beneath her steps as Passion flies
O'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants
For some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.
CXXI.
O Love! no habitant of earth thou art—
An unseen seraph, we believe in thee,—
A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,
But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see,
The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;
The mind hath made thee, as it peopled heaven,
Even with its own desiring phantasy,
And to a thought such shape and image given,
As haunts the unquenched soul—parched—wearied—wrung—and riven.
CXXII.
Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,
And fevers into false creation;—where,
Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?
In him alone.  Can Nature show so fair?
Where are the charms and virtues which we dare
Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,
The unreached Paradise of our despair,
Which o'er-informs the pencil and the pen,
And overpowers the page where it would bloom again.
CXXIII.
Who loves, raves—'tis youth's frenzy—but the cure
Is bitterer still; as charm by charm unwinds
Which robed our idols, and we see too sure
Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's
Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds
The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,
Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;
The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,
Seems ever near the prize—wealthiest when most undone.
CXXIV.
We wither from our youth, we gasp away—
Sick—sick; unfound the boon, unslaked the thirst,
Though to the last, in verge of our decay,
Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first—
But all too late,—so are we doubly curst.
Love, fame, ambition, avarice—'tis the same—
Each idle, and all ill, and none the worst—
For all are meteors with a different name,
And death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.
CXXV.
Few—none—find what they love or could have loved:
Though accident, blind contact, and the strong
Necessity of loving, have removed
Antipathies—but to recur, ere long,
Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;
And Circumstance, that unspiritual god
And miscreator, makes and helps along
Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,
Whose touch turns hope to dust—the dust we all have trod.
CXXVI.
Our life is a false nature—'tis not in
The harmony of things,—this hard decree,
This uneradicable taint of sin,
This boundless upas, this all-blasting tree,
Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be
The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew—
Disease, death, bondage, all the woes we see—
And worse, the woes we see not—which throb through
The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.
CXXVII.
Yet let us ponder boldly—'tis a base
Abandonment of reason to resign
Our right of thought—our last and only place
Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:
Though from our birth the faculty divine
Is chained and tortured—cabined, cribbed, confined,
And bred in darkness, lest the truth should shine
Too brightly on the unprepared mind,
The beam pours in, for time and skill will couch the blind.
CXXVIII.
Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,
Collecting the chief trophies of her line,
Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,
Her Coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine
As 'twere its natural torches, for divine
Should be the light which streams here, to illume
This long explored but still exhaustless mine
Of contemplation; and the azure gloom
Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume
CXXIX.
Hues which have words, and speak to ye of heaven,
Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,
And shadows forth its glory.  There is given
Unto the things of earth, which Time hath bent,
A spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant
His hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power
And magic in the ruined battlement,
For which the palace of the present hour
Must yield its pomp, and wait till ages are its dower.
CXXX.
O Time! the beautifier of the dead,
Adorner of the ruin, comforter
And only healer when the heart hath bled—
Time! the corrector where our judgments err,
The test of truth, love,—sole philosopher,
For all beside are sophists, from thy thrift,
Which never loses though it doth defer—
Time, the avenger! unto thee I lift
My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:
CXXXI.
Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine
And temple more divinely desolate,
Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,
Ruins of years—though few, yet full of fate:
If thou hast ever seen me too elate,
Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne
Good, and reserved my pride against the hate
Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn
This iron in my soul in vain—shall THEY not mourn?
CXXXII.
And thou, who never yet of human wrong
Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!
Here, where the ancients paid thee homage long—
Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
For that unnatural retribution—just,
Had it but been from hands less near—in this
Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
Dost thou not hear my heart?—Awake! thou shalt, and must.
CXXXIII.
It is not that I may not have incurred
For my ancestral faults or mine the wound
I bleed withal, and had it been conferred
With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound.
But now my blood shall not sink in the ground;
To thee I do devote it—THOU shalt take
The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found,
Which if I have not taken for the sake—
But let that pass—I sleep, but thou shalt yet awake.
CXXXIV.
And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now
I shrink from what is suffered:  let him speak
Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,
Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
But in this page a record will I seek.
Not in the air shall these my words disperse,
Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,
And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!
CXXXV.
That curse shall be forgiveness.—Have I not—
Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!—
Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?
Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,
Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?
And only not to desperation driven,
Because not altogether of such clay
As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.
CXXXVI.
From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
Have I not seen what human things could do?
From the loud roar of foaming calumny
To the small whisper of the as paltry few
And subtler venom of the reptile crew,
The Janus glance of whose significant eye,
Learning to lie with silence, would SEEM true,
And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.
CXXXVII.
But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
And my frame perish even in conquering pain,
But there is that within me which shall tire
Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire:
Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.
CXXXVIII.
The seal is set.—Now welcome, thou dread Power
Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here
Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear:
Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene
Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
That we become a part of what has been,
And grow unto the spot, all-seeing but unseen.
CXXXIX.
And here the buzz of eager nations ran,
In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,
As man was slaughtered by his fellow-man.
And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because
Such were the bloody circus' genial laws,
And the imperial pleasure.—Wherefore not?
What matters where we fall to fill the maws
Of worms—on battle-plains or listed spot?
Both are but theatres where the chief actors rot.
CXL.
I see before me the Gladiator lie:
He leans upon his hand—his manly brow
Consents to death, but conquers agony,
And his drooped head sinks gradually low—
And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
The arena swims around him:  he is gone,
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.
CXLI.
He heard it, but he heeded not—his eyes
Were with his heart, and that was far away;
He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,
But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
THERE were his young barbarians all at play,
THERE was their Dacian mother—he, their sire,
Butchered to make a Roman holiday—
All this rushed with his blood—Shall he expire,
And unavenged?—Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!
CXLII.
But here, where murder breathed her bloody steam;
And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,
And roared or murmured like a mountain-stream
Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise
Was death or life, the playthings of a crowd,
My voice sounds much—and fall the stars' faint rays
On the arena void—seats crushed, walls bowed,
And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.
CXLIII.
A ruin—yet what ruin! from its mass
Walls, palaces, half-cities, have been reared;
Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,
And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.
Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?
Alas! developed, opens the decay,
When the colossal fabric's form is neared:
It will not bear the brightness of the day,
Which streams too much on all, years, man, have reft away.
CXLIV.
But when the rising moon begins to climb
Its topmost arch, and gently pauses there;
When the stars twinkle through the loops of time,
And the low night-breeze waves along the air,
The garland-forest, which the grey walls wear,
Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head;
When the light shines serene, but doth not glare,
Then in this magic circle raise the dead:
Heroes have trod this spot—'tis on their dust ye tread.
CXLV.
'While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;
When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;
And when Rome falls—the World.'  From our own land
Thus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall
In Saxon times, which we are wont to call
Ancient; and these three mortal things are still
On their foundations, and unaltered all;
Rome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill,
The World, the same wide den—of thieves, or what ye will.
CXLVI.
Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime—
Shrine of all saints and temple of all gods,
From Jove to Jesus—spared and blest by time;
Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods
Arch, empire, each thing round thee, and man plods
His way through thorns to ashes—glorious dome!
Shalt thou not last?—Time's scythe and tyrants' rods
Shiver upon thee—sanctuary and home
Of art and piety—Pantheon!—pride of Rome!
CXLVII.
Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts!
Despoiled yet perfect, with thy circle spreads
A holiness appealing to all hearts—
To art a model; and to him who treads
Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds
Her light through thy sole aperture; to those
Who worship, here are altars for their beads;
And they who feel for genius may repose
Their eyes on honoured forms, whose busts around them close.
CXLVIII.
There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light
What do I gaze on?  Nothing:  Look again!
Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight—
Two insulated phantoms of the brain:
It is not so:  I see them full and plain—
An old man, and a female young and fair,
Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein
The blood is nectar:—but what doth she there,
With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?
CXLIX.
Full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,
Where ON the heart and FROM the heart we took
Our first and sweetest nurture, when the wife,
Blest into mother, in the innocent look,
Or even the piping cry of lips that brook
No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives
Man knows not, when from out its cradled nook
She sees her little bud put forth its leaves—
What may the fruit be yet?—I know not—Cain was Eve's.
CL.
But here youth offers to old age the food,
The milk of his own gift:—it is her sire
To whom she renders back the debt of blood
Born with her birth.  No; he shall not expire
While in those warm and lovely veins the fire
Of health and holy feeling can provide
Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher
Than Egypt's river:—from that gentle side
Drink, drink and live, old man! heaven's realm holds no such tide.
CLI.
The starry fable of the milky way
Has not thy story's purity; it is
A constellation of a sweeter ray,
And sacred Nature triumphs more in this
Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss
Where sparkle distant worlds:—Oh, holiest nurse!
No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss
To thy sire's heart, replenishing its source
With life, as our freed souls rejoin the universe.
CLII.
Turn to the mole which Hadrian reared on high,
Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,
Colossal copyist of deformity,
Whose travelled phantasy from the far Nile's
Enormous model, doomed the artist's toils
To build for giants, and for his vain earth,
His shrunken ashes, raise this dome:  How smiles
The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,
To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!
CLIII.
But lo! the dome—the vast and wondrous dome,
To which Diana's marvel was a cell—
Christ's mighty shrine above his martyr's tomb!
I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle—
Its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell
The hyaena and the jackal in their shade;
I have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell
Their glittering mass i' the sun, and have surveyed
Its sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem prayed;
CLIV.
But thou, of temples old, or altars new,
Standest alone—with nothing like to thee—
Worthiest of God, the holy and the true,
Since Zion's desolation, when that he
Forsook his former city, what could be,
Of earthly structures, in his honour piled,
Of a sublimer aspect?  Majesty,
Power, Glory, Strength, and Beauty, all are aisled
In this eternal ark of worship undefiled.
CLV.
Enter:  its grandeur overwhelms thee not;
And why? it is not lessened; but thy mind,
Expanded by the genius of the spot,
Has grown colossal, and can only find
A fit abode wherein appear enshrined
Thy hopes of immortality; and thou
Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined,
See thy God face to face, as thou dost now
His Holy of Holies, nor be blasted by his brow.
CLVI.
Thou movest—but increasing with th' advance,
Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,
Deceived by its gigantic elegance;
Vastness which grows—but grows to harmonise—
All musical in its immensities;
Rich marbles—richer painting—shrines where flame
The lamps of gold—and haughty dome which vies
In air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame
Sits on the firm-set ground—and this the clouds must claim.
CLVII.
Thou seest not all; but piecemeal thou must break
To separate contemplation, the great whole;
And as the ocean many bays will make,
That ask the eye—so here condense thy soul
To more immediate objects, and control
Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart
Its eloquent proportions, and unroll
In mighty graduations, part by part,
The glory which at once upon thee did not dart.
CLVIII.
Not by its fault—but thine:  Our outward sense
Is but of gradual grasp—and as it is
That what we have of feeling most intense
Outstrips our faint expression; e'en so this
Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice
Fools our fond gaze, and greatest of the great
Defies at first our nature's littleness,
Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate
Our spirits to the size of that they contemplate.
CLIX.
Then pause and be enlightened; there is more
In such a survey than the sating gaze
Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore
The worship of the place, or the mere praise
Of art and its great masters, who could raise
What former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan;
The fountain of sublimity displays
Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of man
Its golden sands, and learn what great conceptions can.
CLX.
Or, turning to the Vatican, go see
Laocoon's torture dignifying pain—
A father's love and mortal's agony
With an immortal's patience blending:—Vain
The struggle; vain, against the coiling strain
And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,
The old man's clench; the long envenomed chain
Rivets the living links,—the enormous asp
Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.
CLXI.
Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,
The God of life, and poesy, and light—
The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow
All radiant from his triumph in the fight;
The shaft hath just been shot—the arrow bright
With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye
And nostril beautiful disdain, and might
And majesty, flash their full lightnings by,
Developing in that one glance the Deity.
CLXII.
But in his delicate form—a dream of Love,
Shaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast
Longed for a deathless lover from above,
And maddened in that vision—are expressed
All that ideal beauty ever blessed
The mind within its most unearthly mood,
When each conception was a heavenly guest—
A ray of immortality—and stood
Starlike, around, until they gathered to a god?
CLXIII.
And if it be Prometheus stole from heaven
The fire which we endure, it was repaid
By him to whom the energy was given
Which this poetic marble hath arrayed
With an eternal glory—which, if made
By human hands, is not of human thought
And Time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid
One ringlet in the dust—nor hath it caught
A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.
CLXIV.
But where is he, the pilgrim of my song,
The being who upheld it through the past?
Methinks he cometh late and tarries long.
He is no more—these breathings are his last;
His wanderings done, his visions ebbing fast,
And he himself as nothing:—if he was
Aught but a phantasy, and could be classed
With forms which live and suffer—let that pass—
His shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,
CLXV.
Which gathers shadow, substance, life, and all
That we inherit in its mortal shroud,
And spreads the dim and universal pall
Thro' which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud
Between us sinks and all which ever glowed,
Till Glory's self is twilight, and displays
A melancholy halo scarce allowed
To hover on the verge of darkness; rays
Sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,
CLXVI.
And send us prying into the abyss,
To gather what we shall be when the frame
Shall be resolved to something less than this
Its wretched essence; and to dream of fame,
And wipe the dust from off the idle name
We never more shall hear,—but never more,
Oh, happier thought! can we be made the same:
It is enough, in sooth, that ONCE we bore
These fardels of the heart—the heart whose sweat was gore.
CLXVII.
Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,
A long, low distant murmur of dread sound,
Such as arises when a nation bleeds
With some deep and immedicable wound;
Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground.
The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the chief
Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,
And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief
She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.
CLXVIII.
Scion of chiefs and monarchs, where art thou?
Fond hope of many nations, art thou dead?
Could not the grave forget thee, and lay low
Some less majestic, less beloved head?
In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,
The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,
Death hushed that pang for ever:  with thee fled
The present happiness and promised joy
Which filled the imperial isles so full it seemed to cloy.
CLXIX.
Peasants bring forth in safety.—Can it be,
O thou that wert so happy, so adored!
Those who weep not for kings shall weep for thee,
And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard
Her many griefs for One; for she had poured
Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head
Beheld her Iris.—Thou, too, lonely lord,
And desolate consort—vainly wert thou wed!
The husband of a year! the father of the dead!
CLXX.
Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made:
Thy bridal's fruit is ashes; in the dust
The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,
The love of millions!  How we did entrust
Futurity to her! and, though it must
Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed
Our children should obey her child, and blessed
Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed
Like star to shepherd's eyes; 'twas but a meteor beamed.
CLXXI.
Woe unto us, not her; for she sleeps well:
The fickle reek of popular breath, the tongue
Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,
Which from the birth of monarchy hath rung
Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstrung
Nations have armed in madness, the strange fate
Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns, and hath flung
Against their blind omnipotence a weight
Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late,—
CLXXII.
These might have been her destiny; but no,
Our hearts deny it:  and so young, so fair,
Good without effort, great without a foe;
But now a bride and mother—and now THERE!
How many ties did that stern moment tear!
From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast
Is linked the electric chain of that despair,
Whose shock was as an earthquake's, and oppressed
The land which loved thee so, that none could love thee best.
CLXXIII.
Lo, Nemi! navelled in the woody hills
So far, that the uprooting wind which tears
The oak from his foundation, and which spills
The ocean o'er its boundary, and bears
Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares
The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;
And, calm as cherished hate, its surface wears
A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,
All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.
CLXXIV.
And near Albano's scarce divided waves
Shine from a sister valley;—and afar
The Tiber winds, and the broad ocean laves
The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,
'Arms and the Man,' whose reascending star
Rose o'er an empire,—but beneath thy right
Tully reposed from Rome;—and where yon bar
Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight,
The Sabine farm was tilled, the weary bard's delight.
CLXXV.
But I forget.—My pilgrim's shrine is won,
And he and I must part,—so let it be,—
His task and mine alike are nearly done;
Yet once more let us look upon the sea:
The midland ocean breaks on him and me,
And from the Alban mount we now behold
Our friend of youth, that ocean, which when we
Beheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold
Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled
CLXXVI.
Upon the blue Symplegades:  long years—
Long, though not very many—since have done
Their work on both; some suffering and some tears
Have left us nearly where we had begun:
Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run,
We have had our reward—and it is here;
That we can yet feel gladdened by the sun,
And reap from earth, sea, joy almost as dear
As if there were no man to trouble what is clear.
CLXXVII.
Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,
With one fair Spirit for my minister,
That I might all forget the human race,
And, hating no one, love but only her!
Ye Elements!—in whose ennobling stir
I feel myself exalted—can ye not
Accord me such a being?  Do I err
In deeming such inhabit many a spot?
Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.
CLXXVIII.
There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society where none intrudes,
By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
CLXXIX.
Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean—roll!
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
Man marks the earth with ruin—his control
Stops with the shore;—upon the watery plain
The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.
CLXXX.
His steps are not upon thy paths,—thy fields
Are not a spoil for him,—thou dost arise
And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
His petty hope in some near port or bay,
And dashest him again to earth:—there let him lay.
CLXXXI.
The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
And monarchs tremble in their capitals.
The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make
Their clay creator the vain title take
Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war;
These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
Alike the Armada's pride, or spoils of Trafalgar.
CLXXXII.
Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee—
Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?
Thy waters washed them power while they were free
And many a tyrant since:  their shores obey
The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay
Has dried up realms to deserts:  not so thou,
Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play—
Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow—
Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.
CLXXXIII.
Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
Calm or convulsed—in breeze, or gale, or storm,
Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime
Dark-heaving;—boundless, endless, and sublime—
The image of Eternity—the throne
Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
Obeys thee:  thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.
CLXXXIV.
And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
Borne like thy bubbles, onward:  from a boy
I wantoned with thy breakers—they to me
Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
Made them a terror—'twas a pleasing fear,
For I was as it were a child of thee,
And trusted to thy billows far and near,
And laid my hand upon thy mane—as I do here.
CLXXXV.
My task is done—my song hath ceased—my theme
Has died into an echo; it is fit
The spell should break of this protracted dream.
The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit
My midnight lamp—and what is writ, is writ—
Would it were worthier! but I am not now
That which I have been—and my visions flit
Less palpably before me—and the glow
Which in my spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.
CLXXXVI.
Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been—
A sound which makes us linger; yet, farewell!
Ye, who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene
Which is his last, if in your memories dwell
A thought which once was his, if on ye swell
A single recollection, not in vain
He wore his sandal-shoon and scallop shell;
Farewell! with HIM alone may rest the pain,
If such there were—with YOU, the moral of his strain.Embed"
Airplanes,Urban Silk,"5 ContributorsBlack Man’s History LyricsI want to thank Allah for coming and giving to us our leader and teacher here in America, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. I want to thank Brother Benjamin at the outset for doing a wonderful job of opening up our eyes and giving us a good preliminary basic understanding of the means and the objectives of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and also I am thankful to Allah for bringing so many people out here tonight, especially just before Christmas. You know, it's next to a miracle when you get this many of our people together so close to Christmas interested in anything whatsoever that's serious. And actually what this shows is the change that's taking place among the so-called Negroes not only here in New York but throughout the entire world. Today dark mankind is waking up and is undertaking a new type of thinking, and it is this new type of thinking that is creating new approaches and new reactions that make it almost impossible to figure out what the black man is going to do next, and by black man we mean, as we are taught by The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, we include all those who are non-white. He teaches us that black is the basic color, that black is the foundation or the basis of all colors. And all of our people who have not yet become white are still black, or atleast part of the Black Nation,and here at Muhammad's Mosque when you hear us using the term ""black"" we mean everbody who's here, regardless of your complexion. If you're here at the Mosque you're black, because the only ticket you need to get into Muhammad's Mosque is to be black. So if you got in you know you're black. You may not have known that you were black before you came here. In fact, very few of our people really look upon themselves as being black. They think of themselves as practically everything else on the color spectrum except black. And no matter how dark one of our people may be, you rarely hear him call himself black. But now that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has been teaching among the so-called Negroes, you find our people of all complexions going around bragging that ""I'm a black man."" This shows you that a new teaching is taking place and there is new thinking among the so-called Negroes. Yet just yesterday you would have to admit that it was very difficult to get our people to refer to themselves as black. Now all of a sudden our people of all complexions are not apologizing for being black but bragging about being black. So there's a new thinking all over America among the so-called Negroes. And the one who is actually the author of this new thinking is The Honorable Elijah Muhammad. It is what he is teaching that is making our people, for the first time, proud to be black, and what's most important of all, for the first time it makes our people want to know more about black, want to know why black is good, or what there is about black that is good.
I might stop right here to point out that some of you may say, ""I came up here to listen to some religion about Islam, but now all I hear you talk about is black."" We don't separate our color from our religion. The white man doesn't. The white man never has separated Christianity from white, nor has he separated the white man from Christianity. When you hear the white man bragging, ""I'm a Christian,"" he's bragging about being a white man. Then you have the Negro. When he is bragging about being a Christian, he's bragging that he's a white man, or he wants to be white, and usually those Negroes who brag like that, I think you have to agree, in their songs and the things they sing in church, they show that they have a greater desire to be white than anything else. My mother was a Christian and my father was a Christian and I used to hear them when I was a little child sing the song ""Wash Me White As Snow."" My father was a black man and my mother was a black woman, but yet the songs that they sang in their church were designed to fill their hearts with the desire to be white. So many people, especially our people, get resentful when they hear me say something like this. But rather than get resentful all they have to do is think back on many of the songs and much of the teachings and the doctrines that they were taught while they were going to church and they'll have to agree that it was all designed to make us look down on black and up at white.
So the religion that we have, the religion of Islam, the religion that makes us Muslims, the religion that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is teaching us here in America today, is designed to undo in our minds what the white man has done to us. It's designed to undo the type of brainwashing that we have had to undergo for four hundred years at the hands of the white man in order to bring us down to the level that we're at today. So when you hear us often refer to black in almost a boastful way, actually we're not boasting, we're speaking of it in a factual sense. All we're doing is telling the truth about our people. Whenever you exalt black, that's not propaganda; when you exalt white, that's propaganda. Yet no one can give biological evidence to show that black actually is the stronger or superior of the two if you want to make that kind of comparison. So never think ill of the person whom you hear representing The Honorable Elijah Muhammad if an overemphasis seems to be placed on the word black, but rather sit and analyze and try to get an understanding.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that of all the things that the black man, or any man for that matter, can study history is the best qualified to reward all research. You have to have a knowledge of history no matter what you are going to do; anything that you undertake you have to have a knowledge of history in order to be successful in it. The thing that has made the so-called Negro in America fail, more than any other thing, is your, my, lack of knowledge concerning history. We know less about history than anything else. There are black people in America who have mastered the mathematical sciences, have become professors and experts in physics, are able to toss sputniks out there in the atmosphere, out in space. They are masters in that field. We have black men who have mastered the field of medicine, we have black men who have mastered other fields, but very seldom do we have black men in America who have mastered the knowledge of the history of the black man himself. we have among our people those who are experts in every field, but seldom can you find one among us who is an expert on the history of the black man. And because of his lack of knowledge concerning the history of the black man, no matter how much he excels in the other sciences, he's always confined, he's always relegated to the same low rung of the ladder that the dumbest of our people are relegated to. And all of this stems form his lack of knowledge concerning history. What made Dr. George Washington Carver a Negro scientist instead of a scientist? What made Paul Robeson a Negro actor instead of an actor? What made, or makes, Ralph Bunche a Negro statesman instead of a statesman? The only difference between Bunche and Carver and these others I just mentioned is they don't know the history of the black man. Bunche is an expert, an international politician, but he doesn't know himself, he doesn't know the history of the black people. He can be sent all over the world by America to solve problems for America, or to solve problems for other nations, but he can't solve problems for his own people in this country. Why? What is it that ties our people up in this way? The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that it boils down to just one word -- history.
When you study the history of Bunche, his history is different from the history of the black man who just came here from Africa. And if you notice, when Bunche was in Atlanta, Georgia, during the summer NAACP Convention, he was Jim Crowed, he was segregated, he was not allowed to go in a hotel down there. Yet there are Africans who come here, black as night, who can go into those cracker hotels. Well, what is the difference between Bunche and one of them? The difference is Bunche doesn't know his history, and they, the Africans, do know their history. They may come here out of the jungles, but they know their history. They may come here wearing sheets with their heads all wrapped up, but they know their history. You and I can come out of Harvard but we don't know our history. There's a basic difference in why we are treated as we are: one knows his history and one doesn't know his history! The American so-called Negro is a soldier who doesn't know his history; he's a servant who doesn't know his history; he's a graduate of Columbia, or Yale, or Harvard, or Tuskeegee, who doesn't know his history. He's confined, he's limited, he's held under the control and the jurisdiction of the white man who knows more about the history of the Negro than the Negro knows about himself. But when you and I wake up, as we're taught by The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and learn our history, learn the history of our kind, and the history of the white kind, then the white man will be at a disadvantage and we'll be at an advantage.
The only thing that puts you and me at a disadvantage is our lack of knowledge concerning history. So one of the reasons, one of the missions, one of the objectives of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad here in America is not only to teach you and me the right religion but to teach you and me history. In fact, do you know that if you and I know history we know the right religion? The only way that you can become confused, that you can become mixed up and not know which religion belongs to God, is if you don't know history. In fact, you have to know history to know something about God. You have to know history to know something about God's religion. You have to know history to know something about God's people. You have to know history to know something about God's plans and God's purposes, and, as I say, the only people who don't know history are the American so-called Negroes. If you know history, for example, for example, you know when you look at this religion right here  the only way you can explain it is to have a knowledge of history.
Why is it called Christianity? It is called Christianity, they say, because it was named after a man called Christ who was born two thousand years ago. Now you know, brothers and sisters, God is an old God, and the world is an old world. The universe has been here a long time. I think all of you would agree that the universe has been here longer than two thousand years. Then you'll also agree that the universe was made by God Himself, that God created the universe. God created the people who are on this earth, God wouldn't create a universe, God wouldn't set a thing up in the sky that makes nine planets rotate around it, all of them inhabited, you and I inhabiting the planet earth upon which we live -- God wouldn't have done all this and not given people a religion. God put His religion here at the creation of the universe. Now then, since you agree to this and you'll agree also that Christ was born two thousand years ago, this couldn't have been God's religion. Your knowledge of history tells you that God couldn't call His religion Christianity because Christianity is only two thousand years old. So if this is the case, then what was God's religion called before the birth of Christ? Can you see the importance of history? Why, if you didn't know history you'd think that Christianity was God's religion, and you'd be running around here wondering why everybody doesn't practice it. Because some people have a better knowledge of history than others do, it is only the people whose knowledge of history is limited who jump up and say that Christianity is the name of God's religion. If Christianity hasn't always been the name of God's religion it isn't now the name of God's religion. God doesn't change His religion; God doesn't change His mind; God's mind is made up from the beginning. He doesn't have to change His mind because He knows all there is to know all the way down the wheel of time. He never has to change His mind, His mind is made up, His knowledge is complete, all encompassing. Do you understand? So once you can see, and I think you can, then it's almost impossible for God to call Christianity His religion.
What should God call His religion? Christians are the ones who call God's religion Christianity, but God was here before Christians came on the scene. They tell you that Christians began back there with the Romans, with one of the Roman Emperors who accepted the teachings of some of Jesus' disciples and then named what the disciples taught ""Christianity."" But Jesus didn't call it Christianity, it wasn't named until two or three hundred years after Jesus was dead. Right or wrong? Any history book will tell this, any theologian knows this, and the only Negroes who will contend this are those who don't know history, and most Negroes don't know history. Most Negroes will contend this, but when you tell it to the white man he shuts his mouth because he knows that this is true.
Then those who have studied a little deeper will say, ""Before God called it Christianity it was called Judaism"" -- isn't this what they say? Named after a man called Judah. This doesn't follow logically. If Christianity was named after Christ was born, and before Christ was born the religion was called Judaism, then that means that it got its name from a son of Jacob whose name was Judah. But history tells us that Jacob was bending down before Judah was born, which shows us that Jacob's religion couldn't have been Judaism, and Isaac was Jacob's father and he was bending down also before Jacob, his son, was born. Isaac was Judah's grandfather and Abraham was Judah's great-grandfather, meaning that Abraham was on the scene long before Judah, and you couldn't call Abraham's religion Judaism because there was no such thing as Judaism in Abraham's day. There wa no such thing as Judaism in Isaac's day, or in Jacob's day. Do you understand? So what was God's religion before they called it Judaism? This is something that the white man has never taught you and me. The white man is afraid to let you and me know what God's religion was called in Abraham's day because Abraham is supposed to have been the father of all of them. He is supposed to have been one of God's first servants. One of the first to submit to God is supposed to have been Abraham. Now if you can see this, then find out what Abraham's religion was.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that Abraham's religion was the religion of Islam. Islam only means complete submission to God, complete obedience to God. Abraham obeyed God. Abraham obeyed God so much so that when God told Abraham to take his son and sacrifice him -- stick a dagger in his heart, isn't that what he said? -- Abraham took his only son up on the mountain. He was going to sacrifice him to God, showing that he believed in Islam. What does Islam mean? Obey God. Submit to God. So that this name , if you'll notice, has no connection, no association, with the death of a man. This is not a man's name, this doesn't come from a man. Buddhism is named after a man called Buddha; Confucianism is named after a man called Confucius -- right or wrong? Likewise with Judaism and Christianity. But Islam is not connected with any name. Islam is independent of any name. Islam is an act which means submit completely to God, or obey God. And when you say your religion is Islam that means you're a Muslim. So to clarify this what must you do? You must have a knowledge of history. If you don't have a knowledge of history you'll run around calling yourself a Christian when you're serving God, or you'll run around saying your religion is Judaism and you'll swear you're serving God. If your religion is Christianity you're following Christ, if your religion is Judaism you're following Judah, if your religion is Buddhism you're religion is Buddhism you're following Buddha, do you understand? And they are all dead, and if you follow them you'll die too. This is where it all leads you. Wherever your leaders go, that's what happens to you. Now we who follow The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, we believe in Islam, we don't believe in Muhammad.
He teaches us the religion of Islam. Do you understand the difference? These people who follow Christ , they believe in Christ; they believe Christ is God -- Oh yes, they do -- that he was born of the Blessed Virgin, didn't have a father, was just a spirit, and then came into the world and was crucified, rose from the dead, and went up into space. They believe that, but they believe it because they don't know history. But if you notice, the Jews have a better knowledge of history than the Christians do, do they not? the Christians' history only goes back two thousand years; the history of the Jews goes back beyond four thousand years. Can you see this? And the Muslim history goes back...there is no limit to the Muslim history. If you notice, the Christians can only go back to what they call the Greek Empire. That's what they call the Occidental, the beginning of the Occident, the Greek Empire, the Roman Empire, and so forth. The Jews have a knowledg e of history that goes back to Egypt and Babylon. You notice how one goes back...it has no limit. There are no chains on how far you can go back when you are a Muslim. The Christians and the Jews combined go back to whom? To Adam, and they stop right there. And they say beyond him there was nothing happening. The greater their knowledge of history is -- this has an influence on the type of religion that they accept. Do you understand?
All praise is due to Allah. Another example: What makes the royal family of Europe, or any country, differ from the peasant? Royalty knows its ancestry, royalty knows its history, this is what makes them royal. You can't have a king who can't trace his history back to his forefathers. The only way you can be king is to be born a king. If you take away his history, and he doesn't know who his forefathers were, what does he become? A peasant -- a common ordinary man. Same with the Jews and Christians. It's because the Jews have the longest record of history that they can call themselves the Chosen People. The Christians can't call themselves the Chosen People because their history is not long enough. They can't go back to the time when the choice was being made. The Hebrews, the so-called Jews, can go back so far they can lay claim to that which is actually not theirs. But the reason they can claim it is that nobody else they are dealing with can go back far enough to disprove them. Except the Muslims -- do you understand? So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad's mission is to teach the so-called Negroes a knowledge of history, the history of ourselves, our own kind, showing us how we fit into prophecy, Biblical prophecy. When you go to one of the churches you will notice that it is named after some word in their Bible: Big Rock Baptist Church, or Drinking at the Well Baptist Church, Friendship Baptist Church, Union Baptist, Israel Baptist, Jacob's Ladder Baptist. They find some kind of old funny word in their Bible to name their whole religion after. Their whole doctrine is based on a verse in the Bible: ""He rose.""
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad bases what he teaches not on verse but on the entire book. And from beginning to end, he says, he can open up the Book and prove that the Bible agrees with him, and then use the Bible to prove that what they are teaching in the church is wrong. You know that's saying something.
For instance, he says that in Genesis, the fifteenth chapter and the thirteenth verse, just to give you an example: ""And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance."" Now The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that explains his teachings right there, because he teaches that the so-called Negro is the one that the Bible is talking about. Who have spent four hundred years and are strangers in a land that is not theirs? And you can't deny that we are strangers here. I don't think any of you will deny that we are strangers here. We are not in a country where we are made to feel at home. We'll put it that way. There is hardly any Negro in his right mind who can say he feels at home in America. He has to admit that he is made to feel like a stranger. Right or wrong? Well, this is what God said to Abraham would happen in this day and time. Remember, Abraham's religion was Islam. Abraham wasn't a Jew, Abraham wasn't a Christian, Abraham wasn't a Buddhist, Abraham was a Muslim, which means he obeyed God. God told him, yes. He said, your people are gong into bondage, they're going to become slaves, they're going to be afflicted, they'll be strangers in a land far from home for four hundred years. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you and I are the seed of Abraham, we're the descendants of Abraham. Now the preacher in the church, he tells you that the Jews are the seed of Abraham. One of them is right and one of them is wrong: either Mr. Muhammad is right and the preacher is wrong, or the preacher is right and Mr. Muhammad is wrong. This is what we are putting on the line today.
Who is the seed of Abraham? Is it this blue-eyed, blond-haired, pale-skinned Jew? Or is it the so-called Negro -- you? Who is it? And what makes it so pitiful, many of our people would rather believe that the Jews are God's Chosen People than to believe that they are God's Chosen People. They would rather believe that the Jew is better than anybody else. This is a Negro. Nobody else would put everybody else above him but the Negro. I mean the American Negro. Remember, God said that the people would be strangers. The Jews aren't strangers. The Jews know their history, the Jews know their culture, the Jews know their language; they know everything there is to know about themselves. They know how to rob you, they know how to be your landlord, they know how to be your grocer, they know how to be your lawyer, they know how to join the NAACP and become the president -- right or wrong? They know how to control everything you've got. You can't say they're lost. But the poor so-called Negro, he doesn't control the NAACP, he can't control the Urban League, he can't control his own schools, he can't control his own businesses in his own community. He can't even control his own mind. He's lost and lost control of himself and gone astray.
But he fits the picture here that the Bible says concerning our people in the last day: ""Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them."" And you have served the white man; he hasn't served you and me. Why, the Jew hasn't served anybody here. You are the one that's serving: ""And they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterwards shall they come out with great substance."" Ofttimes when you say this to the so-called Negroes they'll come up and tell you that this is the Jew. But if you'll notice, when Jesus was talking to the Jews, way back here in John, he told them that they shall know the truth and it will make them free. The Jews popped up and said: ""How are you going to say that we shall be made free? We have never been in bondage to anyone."" Isn't that what the Jews told Jesus? Now look at it. If the Jews said to Jesus, two thousand years after Moses supposedly led the Hebrews out of bondage, that they had never been in bondage -- now you know the Jews had Moses' history, they knew who Moses was -- how could they stand up and tell Jesus they had never been in bondage? Not these things that you call Jews. They weren't in Egypt, they weren't the people that Moses led out of Egypt, and the Jews know this. But the Bible is written in such a tricky way, when you read it you think that Moss led the Jews out of bondage. But if you get a Jew in a good solid conversation today and you know how to talk to him, he'll have to admit this, that it wasn't out of bondage that Moses brought them -- it was out of somewhere else -- and where Moses really brought them is their secret, but, thanks to Almighty God, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad knows their secret, and he told it to us and we're going to tell it to you.
If the Bible said that God is going to judge that nation, the nation that enslaved His people, how would He keep from destroying His own people? The same Bible is a book of history and in the eighteenth chapter of the book of Deuteronomy, in the eighteenth verse, God told Moses: ""I will raise them up a Prophet"" -- talking about you and me -- I'll raise them up a prophet just like thee -- a prophet like Moses whose mission it would be to do for you and me the same thing that Moses did back them. It would be a prophet like Moses. In fact, when you get down to Malachi, He lets it be known that just before He comes to judge that nation, the name of the prophet or messenger whom He would send among the people would be Elijah. If says: ""Before the coming of that great and dreadful day I shall send you Elijah and Elijah's job will be to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the hearts of the fathers to the children."" What does this mean, turn the hearts of the children to the fathers? The so-called Negro are childlike people -- you're like children. No matter how old you get, or how bold you get, or how wise you get, or how rich you get, or how educated you get, the white man still calls you what? ""Boy!"" Why, you are a child in his eyesight! And you are a child. Anytime you have to let another man set up a factory for you and you can't set up a factory for yourself, you're a child; anytime another man has to open up businesses for you and you don't know how to open up businesses for yourself and your people, you're a child; anytime another man sets up schools and you don't know how to set up your own schools, you're a child. Because a child is someone who sits around and waits for his father to do for him what he should be doing for himself, or what he's too young to do for himself, or what he is too dumb to do for himself. So the white man, knowing that here in America all the Negro has done -- I hate to say it, but it's the truth -- all you and I have done is build churches and let the white man build factories.
You and I build churches and let the white man build schools. You and I build churches and let the white man build up everything for himself. Then after you build the church you have to go and beg the white man for a job, and beg the white man for some education. Am I right or wrong? Do you see what I mean? It's too bad but it's true. And it's history. So it shows that these childlike people -- people who would be children, following after the white man -- it says in the last day that God will raise up Elijah, and Elijah's job will be to turn the hearts of these children back toward their fathers. Elijah will come and change our minds; he'll teach us something that will turn us completely around. When Elijah finds us we'll be easy to lead in the wrong direction but hard to lead in the right direction. But when Elijah gets through teaching the Lost Sheep, or the Lost People of God, he'll turn them around, he'll change their minds, he'll put a board in their back, he'll make them throw their shoulders back and stand upright like men for the first time. It says he'll turn the hearts of these children toward their fathers and the hearts of the fathers toward the children. This is something that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is doing here in America today. You and I haven't thought in terms of our forefathers. We haven't thought of our fathers. Our fathers, brothers, are back home. Our fathers are in the East. We're running around here begging the Great White Father. You never hear of black pe ople in this country talking or speaking or thinking in terms of connecting themselves with their own kind back home. They are trying to make contact with the white man, trying to make a connection with the white man, trying to connect, trying to make a connection with a kidnapper who brought them here, trying to make a connection with, actually, the man who enslaved them. You know that's a shame -- it's pitiful -- but it's true.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that when Elijah comes, the Book says when Elijah comes, what Elijah will do is to teach these people the truth. And the truth that Elijah will teach the people would be so strong it will make all that other stuff that the preachers are talking about sound like a fairy story. Elijah will open the people's eyes up so wide that from then on a preacher won't be able to talk to them -- and this is really true. Do you know, people have come to Muhammad's Mosque and no matter whether they believed in what Mr. Muhammad was saying or not they never could go back and sit in church. This is true. What The Honorable Elijah Muhammad does is to turn on the light, and when he turns on the light it enables us to see and think for ourselves. He shows us that what the white man has taught us concerning history has actually been a distortion. He's never given you and me true facts about history, neither about himself nor about our people. You know I read a book one day called The Four Cities of Troy. You can go to the library, some libraries, and check it out. What was this based on? To show you what a liar the white man is. When Isay liar: you have white people who are scientists and keep truth in their own circles, and they never let you -- they never let the masses -- know anything about this truth that they keep in the circle. They got something else that they invent and put out for the masses to believe, but they themselves keep knowledge in a circle. So in this particular book it pointed out that some archaeologists were delving in the ruins of the ancient city of Troy, and it's the practice of archaeologists to dig, so in digging down into the ruins of Troy they dug deeper than they intended to, and they ran into the ruins of another city that had been there so much longer than this city of Troy that it had gone down beneath the sands of time, and they had built this city of Troy on top of it. When these archaeologists were delving into the ruins of the ancient city they learned that there were ruins of a city more ancient than that. So they started frantically digging onto that one and dug some more until they found another one and before they got through digging they had dug down and they had discovered that civilizations in that area had been there so far back into history that at different times in history some of the cities had been destroyed, had become completely covered up with sand and dirt, until another people came along and didn't even know it was there and built another civilization on top of it. This happened four different times -to give you some idea of what the white man knows concerning the length of time man has been on this earth -- and still that white man would jump up in your face and try to make you believe that the first man was made six thousand years ago named Adam. And a lot of Negroes will want to know what you are talking about -- Adam -- that's what God called him -- God took some dirt and breathed on it and told Adam, ""Come forth,"" and there he was. Now you know that's a shame. It's all right to believe when you were a little baby that God made a little doll out of the sand and mud and breathed on it and that was the first man. But here it is 1962 with all this information floating around in everybody's ears -- you can get it free. Why, you should open up your minds and your heads and your hearts and realize that you have been led by a lie. Today it's time to listen to nothing but naked, undiluted truth. And when you know the truth, as Jesus said: ""The truth will make you free."" Abraham Lincoln won't make you free. Truth will make you free. when you know the truth, you're free. Also you have your archaeologists, anthropologists, other forms of historians who agree that they don't know how long man has been on earth, but they do know that man has been on earth longer than six thousand years. They know that man was not made just six thousand years ago. They know this now but a long time ago they didn't know it. There was a time when they believed that a man had fewer ribs than a woman. You can believe that because they said that God made Eve from one of Adam's ribs -so Adam had a rib missing. And they actually ran around here believing for many years that man had one less rib, and they were shook up when they got into the science of anatomy and discovered that man -- all his ribs were there! They began to wonder then what happened in the Bible?
How long has man been here? In the Bible in the first chapter of Genesis and the twenty-sixth verse, after God had made everything else it says: ""And God said, Let us make man."" Let me write what God said here on the board ... Look what God said, brothers. I don't think you ever looked at this. It says: ""And God said, Let us make man."" The key word here is what? Yes, what does ""us"" mean? More than one. Who was God talking to? If God was all by Himself, no one was there but Him, who was He talking to when He said, ""Let us make man""? Who was there with God who was about to help Him make this man? When God was getting ready to make the sun He didn't say, ""Let us make some sun!"" He said, ""Let there be light."" And here is the sun, a ball of fire 2,679,785 miles in circumference, 853,000 miles in diameter, 17,072 degrees hot, and God said, ""Let there be,"" and that big ball of fire popped up there in the universe, with no help. Now you know something is wrong. It should be harder to make that than man: a huge ball of fire 2,679,785 miles in circumference, 17,072 degrees hot -- that's a whole lot of heat. And God said, ""Let there be,"" and that just jumped up in the universe. He didn't ask for no help: ""Let there be this and let there be that."" He had so much power that everything He wanted came into existence; as soon as He said ""be,"" there it was. But when He got to man something happened, someone else was there, wasn't there? That's something to think about. We let you think about it for a minute...
The white man's world is newer world than the black man's world. If this man said that they were about to make man, and he said we would make him how -- in your image -- this shows you that there's somebody there with him. ""Let us make man on our image, in our likeness. Let us make him look like us. He won't be the same as we are, he'll be in our image."" That's God talking, right? He's talking to somebody. You know, I'm thankful to Allah for raising up The Honorable Elijah Muhammad and making us see these things that we could never see before. The birth of the white race has always been a secret. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that the birth of the white race is shrouded in the story of Adam. The story of Adam hides the birth of the white race, and because you and I have never been taught to look into a thing and analyze a thing we took the story of Adam exactly as it was. We thought that God made a man named Adam six thousand years ago. But today The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that man, Adam, was a white man; that before Adam was made the black man was already here. The white man will even tell you that, because he refers to Adam as the first one. He refers to the Adamites as those who came from that first one. He refers to the pre-Adamites as those who were here before Adam. Right or wrong? Those people who were here before Adam. And he always refers to these people as ""aborigines,"" which means what? BLACK FOLK! You never find a white aborigine. Aborigines are called natives, and they're always dark-skinned people. You and I are aborigines. But you don't like to be called an aborigine; you want to be called an American. Aborigine actually means, ""from the beginning."" It's two Latin words, ""ab"" meaning ""from""; ""origine"" meaning ""the beginning""; and aborigine is only the term applied to those dark-skinned people who have been on this earth since the beginning of the universe. You know that's going way back. What do you mean, since the beginning of the universe?
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that, just as we pointed out a moment ago, the black man has been here a long time. He never has had a beginning. But the white man has never had a knowledge of the history of the black man. It's like a father and a son. If the father is fifty years old and the son is only ten, the father knows everything there is to know about his son because he was here before his son was born; the son only knows what has happened during his own ten years. He only knows what went on before his arrival from what his father tells him. It's the same way with the black man and the white man: the black man's been here a long time, but the white man has been here a short time. Now the white man only knows about himself, what he's been told, and he hasn't been told anything. He came to himself up in the caves of Europe, and he can't get any information that goes beyond the cave. And since you and I fell into his trap and were made deaf, dumb, and blind by him, we don't have access to any information that the white man doesn't know about. So we think that the beginning of the white man meant the beginning of everything, us too. We're not aware that we were here before he was made. Can you understand that? The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that sixty-six trillion years ago -- trillion, how much is trillion? Not hundreds, not thousands, nor millions, nor billions, but sixty-six trillions years ago -- the black man was here. We have the sun which is the center of the universe; 36,000,000 miles form the sun is the planet we call Mercury, and 67,200,000 miles from the sun is the planet called Venus, and 93,000,000 miles from the sun is the planet here that you and I live on called Earth, 141,500,000 miles out here is a planet called Mars, and 483,000,000 miles from the sun is a planet called Jupiter, 886,000,000 miles from the sun is a planet called Saturn, and on down the road a piece are a couple more planets. So right here this planet that you and I live on called Earth, that rotates around the sun, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that sixty-six trillion years ago our people were living on this planet: the black man was living on this planet. But in those days it was larger than it is now, and the planet Mars, that was off here beyond it, had an effect upon our planet then in the same manner that the moon affects us today. At that time there was no moon up there. Where was the moon? The moon was down here, the moon was part of this planet, the moon and this planet were one planet, and the black man was living here then. He was a scientist, he was a wise black man. Black men have always been wise, black men have always been the wisest beings in the universe, and among these beings, black beings, there is one who is supreme; he is referred to as the Supreme Being, do you understand?
So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells us that a wise black scientist, sixty-six trillion years ago, began to argue with the other scientists because he wanted the people of Earth to speak a certain language, and since they wouldn't agree he wanted to destroy civilization. So this scientist drove a shaft into the center of the Earth and filled it with high explosives and set it off. He was trying to destroy civilization; he was trying to destroy the black man. But you can't destroy the black man; the black man can't destroy himself. The black man has the most powerful brain in the universe. So there is no intelligence more powerful than the intelligence of the black man. And because of this the black man can't even create thought that would destroy him. He is indestructible. You can blow up everything and the black man will still be here. You just can't get away from him, brother. So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said he filled the Earth, the planet, with high explosives and set it off, and w hen it was exploded the piece that you and I today call the moon was tossed out here into space and it rotated around the Earth. It still rotates around the Earth; it came from the Earth; it was blasted right off the Earth. And as it was blasted right o ff the Earth, it turned over and over and over and all of the water that was on it stayed with the earth. So that the piece that was blasted out there has no water on it today, and because it has no water on it it has no civilization on it, has no life on it. You can't have life where there's no water there's no life; where there's no life there's no civilization. Can you understand that? So this dead piece, called the moon by us today, turning over and over and over, lost all of its water, all of the water coming with this piece. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad told us that this piece, that the earth, that we remained on, shifted, dropped thirty-six thousand miles in the pocket that we remained in. And as it dropped and all of water came with it, that left a situation in which today the Earth that we now live on weighs six sextillion tons. The weight of it is six sextillion tons. And as it makes its way around the sun, the strong power of the sun's rays striking the equator causes the planet to turn on its own axis at the speed 10371/3 miles per hour. And he teaches us that the square mileage of the Earth is 196,940,000 square miles which means only 57,255,000 square miles of land stuck up out of 139,685,000 square miles of water. Three-fourths of the Earth's surface is covered with water. Part of the water that left the moon is here with the Earth. So you say since it's the natural law for water to seek its own level, why doesn't it overrun the land? The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that as the Earth speeds around the sun turning on its axis 10371/3 miles per hour it creates gravity and the strong attracting power of the sun pulls on the waters of the Earth, drawing them up into the Earth's atmosphere in fine mist that the naked eye can hardly detect. As this water gathers into the Earth's atmosphere it then distills and comes back to Earth. When it gets heavier than the atmosphere in which it is, it distills and comes back to the Earth in the form of water, rain, hail, or snow. All of the water that you see coming out of the sky went up into the sky. Everything that's coming down on the Earth got up there by leaving the Earth. Do you understand? And he teaches us that it comes back down in the form of hail or rain or snow or whatever else you have, depending upon the temperature of the current atmosphere that it was in. He says that at night the gravitational pull of the moon takes over, and, because the power of the moon is not as great as that of the sun, once the attracting power o f the sun is absent at night the moon takes over, but since it can't pull the waters up like the sun does, it still has that magnetic pull and it causes the waves that you see out there on the ocean to churn. It is the moon that does that; the moon makes the waves go up and down. It never lets them level out. If they leveled out the water would overrun the land. It also causes the shifting of the tide. This is the pull of the moon upon the waters of the Earth. If it weren't for the attracting powers of the sun and the moon upon the Earth, the waters would overrun the land and drown out civilization. All of this was done by man himself, not some Mystery God. A black man set this up. And you and I have been running around in the trap that the white man put us in, thinking that the only one who can do anything is a Mystery God and what the Mystery God doesn't do the white man does.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that all the time that this was going on there was no white man. The white man was nowhere on the scene. He says that when the moon was blasted away and we came along with the Earth, one tribe was in fact destroyed. Prior to the time that the explosion took place there were thirteen tribes. In the explosion set off sixty-six trillion years ago the thirteenth tribe was destroyed and then all of the time down through the wheel of time since then there were twelve tribes until six thousand years ago. And six thousand years ago, a scientist named Yacub created another tribe on this Earth.
Understand, prior to the time the explosion took place, there were thirteen tribes, but the thirteenth tribe was destroyed in that explosion and then six thousand years ago another tribe came on the scene. It was made different from all of the twelve tribes that were here when it arrived. A new tribe, a weak tribe, a wicked tribe, a devilish tribe, a diabolical tribe, a tribe that is devilish by nature. So that before they got on the scene, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that when we came with the Earth, the oldest city on the Earth is the Holy City, Mecca, in Arabia. Mecca is the oldest city on Earth. Mecca is the city that is forbidden. No one can go there but the black man. No one can go there but the Muslims. No one can go there but the believer. No one can go there but the righteous. And at Mecca are kept the records of history that go on back to the beginning of time. He says that fifty thousand years ago another scientist named Shabazz became angry with the scientists of his day. He wanted to bring about a tougher people. He wanted the people to undergo a form of life that would make them tough and hard, and the other scientists wouldn't agree with him. So this scientist named Shabazz took his family and wandered down into the jungles of Africa. Prior to that time no one lived in the jungles of Africa. Our people were soft; they were black but they were soft and delicate, fine. They had straight hair. Right here on this Earth you find some of them look like that today. They are black as night, but their hair is like silk, and originally all our people had that kind of hair. But this scientist took his family down into the jungles of Africa, and living in the open, living a jungle life, eating all kinds of food had an effect on the appearance of our people. Actually living in the rough climate, our hair became stiff, like it is now. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that the only hair that the black man has today that looks now like it looked prior to fifty thousand years ago is your and my eyebrows. Right here, you notice, all Negroes has straight -- I don't care how nappy their hair is -- they have straight eyebrows. When you see a nappy-hair-eyebrowed Negro  you got somebody. But all of this took place back in history, and everything The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches is based on history. Now then, where does this white man come in?
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that the wise black man who was a master of science never wrote his history like it is written today, of the past. The wise black man in that day wrote his history in the future. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that the circumference of the Earth is 24,896 miles, approximately 25,000 miles. So when he says the wise black man of the East writes history a year of every mile, he writes history to last for 25,000 years -- not in the past, but in the future. He says that on this Earth there are wise black men who can tune in and tell what's going to happen in the future just as clear -- they can see ahead just as clear -- as they can see in the past. And every 25,000 years he says that civilization reaches its peak, or reaches its perfection. At this time the wise black man can hear a pin drop anywhere on the planet Earth. And they sit down and write history to last for 25,000 years. After this history expires they put it in a vault at the Holy City, Mecca, and write a new history. This has been going on and on and on. So, in the year one of the cycle in which we now live, he says that in the East there are twenty-four wise men. They're spoken of in the Bible as twenty-four elders or twenty-four prophets or twenty-four scientists or twenty-four imams. Twelve of them are major and twelve of them are minor. So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that these twenty-three men are called together by this one, which makes twenty-four. And these twenty-four, these twenty-three presided over by the twenty-fourth, are spoken of in the Book of Revelation where John said he had a vision in heaven where there was a throne, and around the throne were twenty-four seats and on the seats sat twenty-four elders. These twenty -four elders are called angels. They are actually twenty-four wise black men who live right here on this Earth, but no one knows who they are. At the end of every 25,000 years this one calls all of them into conference, and they sit down at the Holy City, Mecca, and he informs them that the history of the past 25,000 years has expired and it's time to write a new history. So these twenty-four, these scientists, begin to tune in on the population of the planet Earth and he says that back in his day -- at that time there were five billion people on this Earth -- all of them black, not a white man in sight -- so he says that when these twenty-four scientists begin to tune in, they look down through the wheel of time. they can tell not only what the people on this Earth are thinking, but they can tell what their children are thinking, what the unborn children's children are thinking. They can look right down through the wheel of time and tell minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour, day-by-day, week-by-week, monthly-by-month, year-by-year, for 25,000 years exactly what is going to take place. And they discovered that in the year 8400 to come it would register that among five billion black people, seventy percent would be satisfied and thirty percent would be dissatisfied. And out of that thirty percent would be born a wise black scientist name Yacub, and Yacub would teach among these thirty percent dissatisfied form whom he would come, and create a new race, start a new world, and a new civilization that would rule this Earth for six thousand years to come. So they brought these findings back to the king and they were put in a book. And by the way, that which is written to last 25,000 years is called the Holy Koran.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that this was put into the history and then when the year 8,400 came, Yacub was born. When Yacub reached the age of six years he was playing in the sand one day with two pieces of metal, two pieces of steel, at which time he discovered what is known as the law of magnetism: that unlike attracts and like repels. Two objects that are alike repel each other like two women repel each other, but man and woman attract each other. Unlike attracts and like repels. Yacub discovered this. So Yacub knew that all he had to do was make a man unlike any other man on this Earth and because he would be different he would attract all other people. Then he could teach this man a science call tricknology, which is a science of tricks and lies, and this weak man would be able to use that science to trick and rob and rule the world. So Yacub turned to his uncle and said, ""When I grow up I'm going to make a man who will rule you."" And Yacub's uncle said,""What can you make other than that which will cause bloodshed and wickedness in the land?"" And Yacub pointed to his head and said,""I know that which you know not."" Yacub was born with a determined idea to make this man because it had been predicted 8400 years prior to his birth that he would be born to do this work. So he was born with this idea in him, and when his uncle realized that this was he about whom it had been prophesied his uncle submitted. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that Yacub went to school in the East; he studied the astronomical sciences, mathematical sciences, and the germination of man. He discovered that in the black man there are two germs. In the black man there's a brown man. In the black man, or the black germ, which is a strong germ, there's a weak germ, a brown germ. Yacub was the first one to discover this and Yacub knew that by separating that brown one from the black one, and then by grafting the brown one from the black one so that it became lighter and lighter, it would eventually reach it s lightest stage which is known as white. And when it got to that stage it would be weak, and because it was weak it would be susceptible to wickedness. And then Yacub could take that weak man that he made and teach him how to lie and rob and cheat and thereby become the ruler of all the rest of the world.
So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that Yacub began to preach at the age of sixteen. He began to preach all over Arabia in the East. He preached among the thirty percent who were dissatisfied and got many of them to follow him. As they began to listen to Yacub's teachings and believe them, his teachings spread, his followers grew, and it created confusion in the land. So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that so much confusion came into existence over there that they threw Yacub's followers in jail, and as fast as they would throw them in jail they taught more people. So the teachings spread in jail. Finally Yacub was put in jail, under an alias. And one day, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says, the thing began to get out of hand and the authorities went to the king and told him that they couldn't control these people, but that they had the leader of the people in jail right now, and the king said, ""Take me to him.""
And when the king went to the jail where Yacub was, he greeted Yacub with ""As-Salaam-Alaikum, Mr. Yacub"" -- I know you're Mr. Yacub -- and Yacub said, ""Wa-Alaikum-Salaam"" -- I am Yacub! And the king said, ""Look, I came to make an agreement with you. I know that you are the one that it is written or predicted would be on the scene in this day and would create a new race, and there is nothing we can do to stop you. But in order for us to have peace we want to make an agreement with you. In order to stop the confusion and for there to be some peace in the land, we want you to agree to take all who will follow you and exile yourselves out on an island in the Aegean Sea.""
Yacub told them, ""I'll go. But you've got to give me everything that I will need to bring into existence a new civilization. You've got to give me everything I'll need. You've got to supply me with everything I need for the next twenty years."" And The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that the king agreed with Yacub, the government of that day agreed to supply Yacub and his followers with everything they needed for twenty years. And he says that he gets this from the Bible where it says Jacob wrestled with the angel. Jacob was Yacub, and the angel that Jacob wrestled with wasn't God, it was the government of that day. ""Angel only means ""a power,"" or somebody with power. When a man has his wings clipped, you say that he has lost his power, lost his position. So wings only mean a position of power entrapped him. So when it says Jacob wrestled with an angel,""angel"" is only used as a symbol to hide the one he was really wrestling with. Jacob was wrestling with the government of that day. He made the government of that day give him everything he needed to last him and his followers for twenty years, just like The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is telling the government of this day that they've got to give us everything that we need in our own separate territory to last us for twenty to twenty-five years. You say, well, The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that Yacub agreed, the government agreed, Yacub took all of his followers down to the sea. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that Yacub took 59,999 of his followers down to the seaside, with himself making 60,000. He piled them in boats and took them out to an island in the Aegean Sea called Pelan. In the Bible it's called Patmos. When you read in the Book of Revelation where John, on the island of Patmos, heard the word of the Lord, that is Yacub. What was John doing on the island of Patmos? John was Yacub. John was out there getting ready to make a new race, he said, for the word of the Lord. What was the word of the Lord? The word was that in the year 8,400 a new man would be made, a new race world be made. And when Yacub and his followers got out there his followers realized that Yacub was wiser than any man of his day, and they recognized him as a god; he was a god to them. So when you get to the place in the Bible where it says, ""And God said, 'Let us make man,'"" that was Yacub too, not the Supreme Being. It wasn't the Supreme Being who made the sun who said, ""Let us make man."" When the Supreme Being made the sun he said, ""Let t here be light."" He said He was supreme, He was independent, He needed no help, no associates. But when it came to making a man, that god said, ""Let us make man."" He didn't speak with independence, because there were two different gods. God the Supreme Being made the light. His word is ""be""; that's how He makes things. But Yacub, who was lesser god, said to 59,999 of his followers, ""Let us make man, let us make a man in our image, in our likeness. We're going to make a white man."" It was Yacub talking: ""Make him in our image and in our likeness, and give him dominion over the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and the creatures of the land. And we'll call him Adam."" It's only a name for the white man. The white man has taken mastery over the air, his airplanes rule the sky, his submarines and ships rule the sea, his armies rule the land. This was the man that was made six thousand years ago and the purpose for making him was so he could rule the world for six thousand years. That's the white man.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that first thing Yacub did was to get his ministers, doctors, nurses, and cremators together. He gave them the laws because he had to set up a birth control law. He told the doctors whenever two black ones come to him to get married to stick a needle in their veins, take some blood, and go back and tell them that their blood doesn't match so that they can't marry. He also said when a black one and a brown one come, let them get married, or if two brown ones come let them get married. Then he told the nurse nine months after they're married, when you're ready to deliver their child, if it's a black child, put a needle in its brain and feed it to a wild animal or give it to the cremator. Let it be destroyed. But if it's a brown child, take that child to the mother and tell her that this is going to be a great man when he grows up because he's lighter than the others. Tell her that the child you destroyed was an angel baby and it went up to heaven to prepare a place for her when she dies. Same old lie they tell you today -- when a little baby dies he goes to the same place a man goes when he dies -- right down into the ground. Is that right or wrong? So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has taught us that Yacub right there set up his birth control law. Within two hundred years they had killed off all of the black babies on the island. Everything black on the island had been destroyed. And then Yacub only lived 150 years. But he left laws and rules and regulations behind, for his followers to go by. And after they had destroyed all of the black on the island of Pelan, they began to work on the brown germ. They saved the yellow and destroyed the brown, because you see in the black there's brown and in the brown there's yellow. Can you see how it goes? The darkest one always has a lighter one in it. So in the black man there's a brown man, in the brown man there's a yellow man, in the yellow man there's what? A white man. Oh yes. Getting weaker all the time. So it took two hundred years to destroy the black. And then they worked on the brown for two hundred years. And in two hundred years all the brown was destroyed and all they had on the island of Pelan was a yellow or mulatto-looking civilization. And then they went to work on it and began to destroy it. So that after six hundred years of destruction on the island of Pelan, they had grafted away the black, grafted away the brown, grafted away the yellow, so that all they had left was a pale-skinned, blue-eyed, blonde-haired thing that you call a man. But actually the Bible calls him the devil. That's the devil that the Bible is talking about: old Lucifer, Satan, or the serpent. Because the lighter they got, the weaker they got. As they began to get lighter and lighter they grow weaker and weaker. Their blood became weaker, their bones became weaker, their minds became weaker, their morals became weaker. They became a wicked race; by nature wicked. Why by nature?
The Book says concerning the devil : ""He was conceived in inequity and born in sin."" What does this mean? At the outset the nurses had to kill the little black babies, but after a while it got so that the mother, having been brainwashed, hated that black one so much she killed it herself. Killed it herself, and saved the light one. And right on down for six hundred years. In order for the white one to come into existence, the darker one was always murdered, murdered, MURDERED! this went right in to the nature of the child that was being born. The mother wanted a light baby when the child was being conceived. This went right into the baby. The mother hated black when the child was being conceived. this went right into the baby. So that at the end of the six hundred years, after planting the seed of inequity right into the brain, right into the mind, right into the heart, right into the nature of these people, by the time they got the white man, they had someone who by nature hated everything that was darker than he was. Why, they had to murder off the black to get to the brown. They had to murder off the brown to get to the yellow. They had to murder off the black, brown, and yellow in order to get to the white. And right to this very day the white man by nature wants to murder off the black, brown, and yellow. You don't have to teach him to kill the black man. He does it for sport. He does it for kicks. he does it because it's his nature to do it. Do you understand that?
So in six hundred years now they got a devil in the scene, a blue-eyed devil, bond-haired. Oh yes, they were out here on the island of Pelan. Yacub was dead. Yacub was their father but he never saw them. They never saw him. Yacub was their god. When the Bible says no man has seen God, that's what it means. No white man has seen their god. None of them saw Yacub because Yacub only lived to be 150 years old. This doesn't mean that no man can see God the Supreme Being. Why, the Book of Revelation says when He comes every eye will see Him. So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says after these devils got grafted -- now we're not going to call them white any more. We call them what they are. White, that's their color, but devil, that's what they are. These aren't white people. You're not using the right language when you say the white man. You call it the devil. When you call him the devil you're calling him by his name -- serpent; another name -- snake; another name -- beast. All these names are in the Bible for the white man. Another name -- Pharaoh; another name -- Caesar; another name -- France; French; Frenchman; Englishman; American; all those are just names for the devil.
So after they were out there six hundred years, after they were made and grafted and Yacub was dead, then they packed up their bags and made it back to civilization. Yacub had left them some laws to go by. He left them a science called ""tricknology"" : how to divide and conquer. Yacub told these people in his book : ""All you got to do to take over the world is lie. Go back among the black people. Take your woman and send her to the black man's woman and let her lie about the neighbor across the street. And then send another woman to that woman to lie on this woman to that woman. And when they get through spreading those lies and they all started fighting and killing one another, you tell them to let you be the mediator."" This is the trick the white man used. It all comes from Yacub. You see, he's an underdog. He's a minority, and the only way a minority can rule a majority is to divide the majority. This is the trick that the white man was born to execute among dark mankind here on this Earth. Yacub said, ""When you go back among them, lie about them to each other, and when they start fighting, ask them to let you be the mediator. And as soon as you become the mediator then you're the boss."" The white man has done this trick everywhere. Here in America to the Indians. He sent one priest to the Indians in New York and another priest to the Indians in Pennsylvania and both of them would tell lies to both Indians, and the Indians who had never been at war with each other would start beating the tom-toms, the war drums, and then as they got ready to fight the priest would rum in and say, ""Let me be the mediator.""
So he told the New York Indians, you just move out to Minnesota; and the Pennsylvania Indians, you move out to Oklahoma. That would leave the whole states of New York and Pennsylvania for the white man. You see how he does it? He's all over the world. He's a mediator. He's an instigator and a mediator. he instigates division and dissension and as soon as they start fighting one another he says, ""OK, I'll settle it."" if you don't think so look all over the world right now. Every place on this earth you have a division: South Korea-North Korea, South Vietnam-North Vietnam. Right or wrong? He is the one that makes this decision. he doesn't let anybody get together, but when it comes to his kind he's united. United States means all white people are united. United States of Europe, or European Common Market -- they want to get together. But when you start talking about a United States of Asia, or a United States of Africa, why he says,""Oh no, too many different languages . You all don't have anything in common."" You see how he does it? He always discourages unity among others but he encourages unity among his own kind. ""United We Stand,"" that doesn't mean you. That means the white man. The white man it the one who stands united.
So The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that these devils went back into Arabia. When they got there they started telling lies, started confusion, and in six months' time they had turned heaven into hell. Oh yeah, they had so much fighting going on among our people, brother, it became hell. We never did fight each other; we loved each other, we were in harmony with each other. And when these devils came back into our midst they turned our paradise into a hell. So it was taken to the king and the king looked into the book and said, ""Why, these are Yacub's people."" He said, ""They were made to do what they're doing and the only way to have peace is to get rid of all of them. Put them all to death."" So the king gave the order for all of the devils to be rounded up. And by devils I mean all those blue-eyed, blond-haired, white things. He gave orders for them to be rounded up there in the East, and they were rounded up. They were rounded up and taken down to the edge of the Arabian Desert. They were stripped naked, stripped of everything except their language. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that we put lambskin aprons around their waists to hide their nakedness. We put them in chains and marched them across the hot sands of the Arabian Desert . This is what the black man did to the white man, brothers. This is what the gods did to the devils. Actually, if you think I don't know what I'm talking about, those of you who are Masons, you go through this and don't understand it. When you go in , they put a lambskin apron around your waist. They put you in what's called the ""cable tow."" Right or wrong? And then they make you jump up and down on an electric mat. Make you take off your shoes and put the juice in the mat and make you jump up and down. Why? What are they getting at? That's all a sign of what happened to the white man six thousand years ago. It just doesn't have anything to do with you, but you're supposed to be walking on hot sands when you jump up and down. Right or wrong? You've all been in some of that stuff. They tell you that's crossing the hot sand. And if you walk up to a Negro Mason and you ask him, ""When you crossed the hot sand were you walking or riding?"" he'll say, ""I was walking."" He's a fool. Because he was riding. He was riding horseback. He was riding on a camel. It was the white man that was in chains. It was the white man that had the apron around him. It was the white man that was walking the white sand. We walked them at high noon. We wouldn't even let them walk at night. We stopped at night. And you know how hot the sun and the sands are in Arabia. We expected the white man to die when we were running him out of the East. But that fool lived, brother . He lived. A lot of them died on the desert. And I might come back -- all of this is tied up in the Masonic ritual. When a man gets initiated into the higher degrees of that order he goes through this. They put on the chains, they put on the aprons, and they darken him up and pretend to be driving him across. Then when he gets up to the top order in those degrees, they tell him what it means. The white man, they tell the white man what it means; a white Shriner, a white Mason, what it means. A Negro never learns what it means. But it actually points back toward the time when the white man, who is the devil, or Adam, as they say, was cast out of the Garden. When the Bible says Adam sinned and was cast out of the Garden, this is what is meant. And an angel was put at the East gate to keep him from coming back in. When the white man was run out of the East by the Muslims six thousand years ago into the caves of Europe, the people called Turks were put there at the Straits of the Dardanelles, with swords, and any old devil that they caught trying to come back across the water - WHOP! - off went his head. The Book tells you that the angel had a flaming sword, and any time any of them tried to come back across they were put to death.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that the white man went down into the caves of Europe and he lived there for two thousand years on all fours. Within one thousand years after he had gotten there he was on all fours, couldn't stand upright. You watch an old cracker today. Crackers don't walk upright like black people do. Every time you look at them, they're about to go down on all fours. But those who have had some education, they straighten up a little bit because they're taught how to straighten up. But a black man can be the most dumb, illiterate thing you can find anywhere, and he still walks like a million dollars because by nature he's upright, by nature he stands up. But a white man has to be stood up. You have to put a white man on the square. But the black is born on the square.
Can we prove it? Yes. You notice in the East, dark people carry things on their heads, don't they? Just throw it up there and walk with it, showing you they have perfect poise, perfect balance. It just comes natural to them. You and I lost our poise. We, you, can't even wear a hat on your head, hardly, today . The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that within one thousand years after the white people were up in the caves they were on all fours. And they were living in the outdoors where it's cold, just as cold over there as it is outside right now. They didn't have clothes. So by being out there in the cold their hair got longer and longer. Hair grew all over their bodies. By being on all fours, the end of their spine begin to grow. They grew a little tail that came out from the end of their spine...Oh yes, this was the white man, brother, up in the caves of Europe. He had a tail that long. You ever notice that anything that walks on all fours has a tail? That which straightens up doesn't have a tail, because when you get down, you see, you just make that spine come right on out. And just like a dog, he was crawling around up there. He was hairy as a dog. He had a tail like a dog. He had a smell like a dog. And nothing could get along with him but another dog. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that all the beasts up in Europe wanted to kill the white man. Yeah, they tried to kill the white man. They were after the white man. They hated the white man. So, he says, what the white man would do, he'd dig a hole in the hill, that was his cave. And his mother and his daughter and his wife would all be in there with the dog. The only thing that made friends with the white man was the dog. Everything else hated him. He'd sit outside of the cave at night in a tree with rocks in his hand, and if any beast came up and tried to get in the cave at his family, he'd throw rocks at it, or he'd have a club that he'd swing down and try to drive it away with it. But the dog stayed in the cave with his family. It was then that the dog and the white man amalgamated. The white woman went with the dog while they were living in the caves of Europe. And right to this very day the white woman will tell you there is nothing she loves better than a dog. They tell you that a dog is a man's best friend. They lived in that cave with those dogs and right now they got that dog smell. They got that dog...they are dog lovers. A dog can get in a white man's house and eat at his table, lick out of his plate. They'll kiss the dog right on the nose and think nothing of it. You're not a dog kisser. You don't see black people kissing or rubbing noses with dogs. But little white children will hug dogs and kiss dogs and eat with dogs. Am Iright or wrong? You -- all have been inside their kitchens cooling their food, and making their beds, you know how they live. The dog will live right in the white man's house, better than you can; you try and break your way in there and they'll put a rope around your neck , but the dog has got free run of the whole house. He's the white man's best friend.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that they lived up there for two thousand years, and at the end of two thousand years the scientists in the East, realizing that it was originally predestined that the white race would rule for six thousand years, and that they already lost two thousand years in the caves of Europe, sent a prophet up there, form Mecca, to teach the white race, the race of devils, how to become civilized again, and become upright, and come back and rule the way they had originally been meant to. The name of that prophet was Moses. Moses never went down into Egypt. Moses went into the caves of Europe and civilized the white man. It was Moses who raised the devil from a dead level to a perpendicular and placed him on the square. Moses taught the white man how to cook his food. Moses taught the white man how to build a house for himself. He taught the white man also some of the tricknology that Yacub had originally meant for him, and it was Moses who put the white man back on the road toward civilization. He told him that he was supposed to rule for six thousand years, but that much of the time had already been lost, and at the end of time one would come who would destroy the whole white race. Moses taught them this. And this is why when the Jews, two thousand years later, were looking for the Messiah, they thought that Jesus was the Messiah and they put him to death because they knew when the Messiah came he was going to destroy that whole race of devils. The Jews knew this, so they put him to death thinking that they could stop him from destroying them. But actually, they made a mistake because Jesus two thousand years ago wasn't the Messiah. Their time wasn't up two thousand years ago. Their time would not be up until two thousand years later, the day and time that we're living in right now.
So, brothers and sisters, my time has expired. I just wanted to point out that the white man, a race of devils, was made six thousand years ago. This doesn't mean to tell you that this implies any kind of hate. They're just a race of devils. They were made six thousand years ago, they were made to rule for six thousand years, and their time expired in the year 19914. The only reason God didn't remove them then was because you and I were here in their clutches and God gave them an extension of time -- not them an extension of time, but they received an extension of time to give the wise men of the East the opportunity to get into this House of Bondage and ""awaken"" the Lost Sheep. Once the American so-called Negroes have been awakened to a knowledge of themselves and of their own God and of the white man, then they're on their own. Then it'll be left up to you and me whether we want to integrate into this wicked race or leave them and separate and go to our own. And if we integrate we'll be destroyed along with them. If we separate then we have a chance for salvation. So on then note, in the name of Allah, and His Messenger The Honorable Elijah Muhammad, I bring my talk to a close, ""As-Salaam Alaikum.""
With your hands outstretched in this manner, follow silently in the closing Muslim prayer: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful, All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, The Beneficent, the Merciful, Master of this Day of Judgment in which we now live, Thee do we serve and Thee do we beseech for thine aid. Guide us on the right path, The path upon which Thou hast bestowed favors, Not the path upon which Thy wrath is brought down Nor of those who go astray after they have heard Thy teaching Say : He Allah is one God Allah is He upon whom nothing is independent but Upon whom we all depend He neither begets nor is He begotten and none is like Him. I bear witness there is none to be served but Allah, And I bear witness that The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is His True Servant and Last Apostle...Amen2Embed"

I'm the headmaster and you're my slave
Metaphor master, rhymes are disaster

Girlies wanna stop and talk but I walk

If rappers wanna play - go ride a sleigh
I'll compare and dare with a stare
You say where?  I'm over here
Metaphor physical, rhymes are artistical lyrical mircales
Difficult, to some terrifical
Hypothetically, alphabetically
Energetically, theoretically
No joke hardcore, rhymes will sting more
Dog will get more, yes yes yes y'all
I manifest protest and progress
Confess with reflex, cause I get cold sex
I can't believe how dope I am
Give me a pound, thank you ma'am
So whether you think that I'm just a myth

To shift the spliff that's in control to hold and fold

Gimme a second, to think of

The metaphor better for, if and in awe
Before the score, want more then implore
The rhyme line fine, com-bine design
Redefine, intertwine
Down the line, see the sign, stop sign
Pause -- and let me enter your brain
Reachin the full circumfrence then maintain
To build, in which I equal to destroy
I'm like a twister tornado, you're just a toyboy
Made, manufactured by, Parker Brothers
You bought your rhymes, from another wholesale
Words are stale, up to bail
Cause you fail, try to trail
My certain style, words and rhythm for connecting
Dissecting, interjecting, I'm collecting
Fiends, the way it actually should be know to me
Cause that's the way it has to be done for me
Mine, and everyone else around
You're unequal to the sounds of my ratio
My strength is mental universal power
For the hour I will rain like a shower
Nucleon, cause you be on, fatal
More than able, also capable
Of takin you out without a doubt
And with clout just a sissy, a sucker girl scout
I'll rewind myself and then begin again
Strike ignite and burn, just like hydrogen
Come again, as I intend to start to end
To go beyond, means of a titan
I'm fightin, releasing my fury to cause static
And shine, the superstar, reign supreme

Dope and def, the best that never fessed
Unless you guessed the test, a threat in chess
Never mess up for my Chorus Line
	Yo Ced, here's your rhyme

Metaphor layer, kickin it righteous
Ced Gee's the hypest, man that might just
Rip into this, rap right through this

The fact I sound def means that I'm buildin
I'm so dope I got rhymes by the million
The image maker breaker taker faker shaker
You rhyme like me, you shoulda stayed the
Hell out the industry, cause that means you're jockin me
Your sweating me, getting me, telling me, you're not ahead of me
But that's not all, I just feel that I'm better than
Cause I'm Ultra, and I'm a veteran
With rhymes, by the thous', stacks and piles
I'm a scientist, you say how
The hell can we ever trust, Ced Gee when he starts to bust
A rhyme with gale force, conducting with mega-thrust
To build or ill or kill or deal a fill the will
That make the people straight and still
To prance and dance and find romance and take the chance
To glance, while I still deal
Rhymes that's powerful, witty and logical
Mystical just to show, what I know when I go
Out, and move on the battle tip
You rhymes like , you'se a quick pick to stick
The type of hype I like to recite on - my Chorus Line
	Yeah boy it's a Chorus Line
	Aiyyo Keith (yo) you know what?

My style within - holds the righs to win
Your brain I bend, like a pound of steel
Lethal power, to me you're weasel power

Bye Bye (made popular by Mariah Carey) [backing version],Party Tyme,"1 ContributorEminem vs Canibus: “The most theatrical emcee battle of all time” LyricsEminem vs Canibus: ""The most theatrical emcee battle of all time"" (FINAL UPDATE: 10/13/07) ...
Mar 27 '05 (Updated Oct 14 '07)
The Bottom Line All the information you need to know on this beef.
NOTE: This is the final re-post of the review. Any more updates will just be made to this review and not deleted and reposted like previous times. WARNING: this essay is EXTREMELY LONG so unless you want a real in-depth look at this lyrical battle, don’t read this. Otherwise, enjoy.
MOST RECENT UPDATE: 10/13/07
I’m sure every Hip-Hopper has heard about the beef that has gone one between the two well known emcees Canibus and Eminem. On one side, you have Canibus, the emcee who, for the most part, stays one dimensional and gives us mostly battle raps. Already known for his publicized beef with LL Cool J, and his less publicized beefs with Beanie Sigel and Truck Turner, Bis can be vicious as he wants to in battle. On the other side you have Eminem, the popular emcee who is known most for his ill lyrics and shock tactics. Aside from LL, Em is probably the most battle tested emcee of all time. But while Em was already familiar with lyrical beefs, Bis was his first real competition and the first rapper who you could honestly match him line for line (I mean come on, can you call Ja Rule, Everlast, Benzino, or the Insane Clown Posse lyrical competition for Em?). Many believe it just started when Em called him ""Canibitch’ on his 2002 album, ""The Eminem Show"", but thats not true. Not to many people know that the beef has been boiling since before Em was even signed. I’ll be the first to admit that many of the disses here are pure speculation but there are some that are straight out obvious. Let me fill you in on what has been described as ‘the most theatrical emcee battle of all time’:
In 2002, Em spoke on how the beef with Canibus started on Tim Westwood’s hip-hop radio show in the United Kingdom, all while him and Proof (of D12) called Bis names like ‘Canibitch’ and ‘Canishit’. While the audio itself is extremely hard to find on its own, someone was cool enough to upload the interview to Youtube, so you can hear it here:
According to Em, the beef started in 1998, before Em was even signed. Of course, a different beef was heating up at that time: Bis and LL Cool J. LL had just released “The Ripper Strikes Back”, a response to Bis’ “Second Round K.O.”. The diss track as a whole was decent, though L relied on using stuff Bis said in his track to go back at him, and not doing anything original. In fact, the best original disses were aimed not at Bis, but at Mike Tyson, who appeared with Bis on the track. Canibus’ manager at the time, Wyclef Jean, told Bis that he heard Eminem ghostwrote the lyrics to the track. With that, Bis and Wyclef invited Em to the video shoot of the Canibus song “I Honor U” so they could talk to him about it directly. Wyclef asked him first, and Em denied the claims that he wrote it. Later, Bis asked Em again separately. Em’s reply to him was that “Yo, I’m a grown man. I would tell you if I wrote it or not”. Em then said he wanted to do something with Bis, like a collaboration or something. Bis’ response was “Yo dogg, get to know me first”, with Bis basically acting rude towards him.
It must be noted that Em apparently had much love for Bis before the situation at the video shoot. It was reported Em gave Bis a lot of props in an interview and upon further investigation, I found an online internet chat dated 5/14/98 where Em gives Bis props (the link to the whole review is here: http://web.archive.o...ew/eminem.htm):
MainframeC: Eminem...Who Do You Think Right Now is the Best Battle Emcee You Faced Besides Juice?
Eminem: MainframeC, first of all I give Juice the maddest love. I haven't faced the best..but to me Canibus is the best. I love him. But some people who I think is ILL, Thirstin Howl, WordsWorth, Aristotle, Royce the 5 Nine he is on my album, Jive T, and the list goes on.
And later, which someone else brings Bis up again, Em continues to show love:
NiTRoNeOX: Eminem ,why do u think canibus is so ill?
Eminem: NitroNeoX, cause I mean str8 up he is more than a battle MC, if you heard the track on Bulworth called ""How come""and his delivery to me is ill...just listen to him. If you don't like him then you shouldn't be listening to rap... He is the MC at the moment..
However, after this whole situation went down (as well as Bis' debut coming out and receiving less-than-stellar reviews), Em's opinion obviously seemed to change. And that;s when the dissig started.
Em started taking shots at Bis in two of his tracks. The first was on his major label debut, “The Slim Shady LP” on the song “Role Model”: “I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this / if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus / I’ll strangle you to death then I’ll choke you again / Then break your fuckin’ legs till your bones poke through your skin / You beef wit me, I'mma even the score equally / Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat your ass legally”. I know you could say that could’ve been taken either way, but I believe it was a diss referencing the ghostwriting incident in a peculiar way. It should also be noted that ""Role Model"" was later released as a radio single, and just like the previous singles released from the album (""My Name Is"" and ""Guilty Conscience"") some of the raunchier and more explicit lines were changed. The lines directly following 'the battle rap for Canibus' lines were changed for the mention of killing, but these new lines made another reference to Canibus, this time talking about LL and stealing the mic off his arm, referencing Bis' original changed lines from ""4,3,2,1"" (which is how the beef between L and Bis started). The censored, radio version of ""Role Model"" goes like this: “I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this / if you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus / a Hellspawn, dropping a stealth bomb / six mics in The Source, they borrowed one from LL's arm”.
The second track was “Get You Mad” from the Sway and Tech “This or That” mix. The first two lines don’t diss Bis, but refer to his beef with LL in the same matter that the edited lines from ""Role Model"" did: “My attitude is worse than NWA's was, I'll battle you over stupid shit / and diss people who don’t have shit to do with it, like Cool J Does (MY TATTOO!)"" but the real diss towards Bis was later on, when Em talked about his ‘plan for emcees to get record deals’: “Lesson Three: Get a job at a label / Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)” I believe that diss was a shot at Bis’ material, saying that if you switch your demo with Canibus, you'll surprise the label heads because Canibus' shit isn’t impressive.
Also Em apparently slammed Bis in an interview after his Slim Shady LP was released; he was asked this question: ""If you could take back anything you said, what would it be?"" Em replied ""That Canibus is dope, cause he isn't"".
Ok, now back to Em’s explanation of the beef from the Westwood show. According to Em, Canibus came to see him on the Warped Tour the following year and apologized for his reactions and asked if Eminem was still up for doing collaboration. Em said yes and so the track was going to be made for Bis’ second album, 2000 B.C. Bis presented Em with the track “Phuk U”, with only Bis’ first two verses on there, and the third verse for Em to fill in. Unfortunately, Em said he wasn’t feeling the track and turned it down. When the track came out Em said the third verse sounded like it was directed toward him or LL, but he couldn't really tell. However, in an interview with allhiphop.com in 2001 (done right after C True Hollywood Stories came out), Bis was asked if he directed the verse at Em:
""Now with the subtle disses to Em on this CD, did you have a verse dissing Eminem on the song ""F-YOU"" off your last album?
You know I’ve heard people talking about that but I wouldn’t say that it was about Eminem. Everytime people hear me rhyme they analyze my lyrics to death. But as far as Eminem, let me say this- I got a mutual respect for Eminem because between his rhyming content and delivery, I think he's tight and that goes with out saying. He's got the total package and has proven himself in the arena of selling records. So for the record I do wanna say that he is tight without a shadow of a doubt. If you ask Em about me he will say the same thing about me. As far as our careers it's just that he ran off with Dre when he got in the game and I ran off with Clef you know? If the tables were turned then maybe things would have been different also.""
Is the verse directed at Em or not? You be the judge:
""Aiyyo, your superstar status don't mean shit to me
Lyrically, sucker emcees still get fricasseed
Try to diss me now, how you sound?
Yo, whoever signed you must be runnin' the circus cuz you a clown
You a rapper wit a drug habit, hidin' the truth
Camouflagin ya needle tracks wit some colorful tattoos
You was never equipped for this, never equipped to spit wit Bis
I'm swift as shit, let me point out the main differences
You magnificent, I'm ‘Mic-Nificent’
Yo, I’d even go out on a limb wit it, say you write a little bit
That don't make you a tight lyricist cause you don't practice or stick with it
Look at the 60 hour shifts I spend wit this
I never quit, I got a gift for the art
A low-maintenance cost, no physical moving parts
In 98, niggas thought I was God, how the FUCK did that change?
I'm STILL one of the illest niggas in the game
So look inside yourself, and tell me what you see
If you see a hungry nigga then you looking at me
And it’s alright if you don’t trust me cause I don’t trust you
As a matter of fact, I'd probably bust you, motherfucker, FUCK YOU!""
- Canibus, third verse of “Phuk U”
2000 B.C. leaked a few months before it was released in July so Em had heard it I’m guessing in May, right before his 2nd major album, “The Marshall Mathers LP” was released. After this, the freestyle disses started coming on the radio and live shows. Eminem and Proof went on Tim Westwood’s show in 2000, taking an outright shot at Canibus in a freestyle. Bis never really dissed Em before then, but he did say a few things that could’ve been aimed at Em. The first of these lines were used in a 100 bar freestyle at Hot 97’s Radio Station on the day before his album was released, perhaps making a reference that Em was wack because he was ""not black"". Another line from that freestyle could've been a reference to Em's lines from the Westwood freestyle (listed below), saying Bis can freestyle. Another one of these supposed jabs by Bis towards Em was at a live show in England. Shortly after performing what would become the next LL diss track, “Rip the Jacker”, he kept freestyling and said a line that could have been aimed at Em, saying his stuff at the Rap Olympics, where competed and lost in the final round, was wack.
“Plus I provoke you and then I bust
Freestyles y’all can’t trust, I’m like Canibus
I bust, Can I Bus? No you can’t
But yes I can, cause I’m Slim Shady and I’m the man”
- Eminem, freestyling over ""4, 3, 2, 1” on the Tim Westwood radio show in 2000
“Aiyyo, we flex styles like a Bisec’
I found out where Canibus’ money went, I borrowed a dollar from Wyclef”
- Proof, freestyling over ""4, 3, 2, 1” on the Tim Westwood radio show in 2000 (Immediately following Em’s lines listed above)
“Thought I couldn't freestyle? You must be freebasing'""
...
""Listen, it’s not like I’m wack, it’s not like I can’t rap
It’s not like I’m not black so cop that”
- Canibus, Release Day freestyle on DJ Clue’s show on July 17th (the day before 2000 B.C. came out)
“And I’m tired of all these wack niggas and wack wiggers
With wack lyrics, bring that shit to the Rap Olympics”
- Canibus, Freestyling live in London in December in 2000
Things stayed quiet for a while; Eminem’s career skyrocketed, while Canibus’ career went, sadly, downwards. Bis became a very depressed individual, and released his third album, “C True Hollywood Stories”, in 2001, in an attempt to sacrifice himself and leave the game forever. The most well known track on the album was “U Didn’t Care”, where Bis continued the story of “Stan”, the Eminem track from the MMLP. He spoke as Stan for the entire track; It was a creative amusing conceptual song that proclaimed Canibus' dedication to his fans, saying he’s different from the mainstream artists who could care less about them. It’s viewed as an Eminem diss song, but he didn’t diss him much until the last verse. He spoke on the ghostwriting incident, and then took a few actual shots at Em by reminding him (still as Stan) that he too was once the fan and that we all have idols.
“Matter of fact, I think he (Bis) met you
It was the day you came to his video shoot with DJ, Jimmy's nephew *
'Clef stepped to him and told him he should step to you
That you was ghostwriting for L, but that wasn't true
You was lookin’ at him the same way I'm lookin’ at you
Why can't we be friends Em'? I don't want nothin’ from you
You see there's a little bit of Stan in all of us
Tell me, where you think all of these record sales spawned from?
Talkin’ 'bout Britney and Christina Aguilera?
N'sync too, have you ever looked in a mirror?
Your hair ain't really blonde, and ya eyes ain't blue
So never diss me, cuz when you diss me you’re dissin’ you""
- Canibus, from “U Didn’t Care”
* NOTE: 'Jimmy' is a reference to Jimmy Iovine, founder of Interscope Records, which is the parent label to Shady/Aftermath
In 2002, Em decided he wouldn’t let Bis get away with dissing him. On his album, “The Eminem Show”, he took various shots at the Canibus man. The first of these tracks were “Square Dance”. Everyone thought this track was a diss towards Nelly since Em used the southern drawl Nelly used in “Hot in Herre”, but that wasn’t the case here. Em refers to him as 'Canibitch', in the first verse (""Canibitch don't want no beef with Slim / NO! Not even on my radar / so won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off"") and the outro (""Canibitch won't square dance with me / Fanibitch won't square dance with me / Canada-bis don't want no parts of me...), but most of the disses are subliminal. The lines ""On your knees, got you under siege / Somebody, you would give a lung to be / Hun-ga-ry, like a fuckin younger me / Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free"" are a rebuttal to the track ""Phuk U"" (he’s referring to is ""look inside yourself..."" lines). And the lines ""Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny, I have the money / to have you killed by somebody who has nothing"" are a rebuttal to the line from the Jay-Z diss from CTHS ""I Got a Story to Tell"" (I had nothing before and I have nothing now / Fuckin with a nigga with nothing only brings you down""). The other subliminal diss is one line referencing Bis' song ""Draft Me!"" (where Bis talked about defending his country) which then leads him into some introspective lyrics about getting drafted for the army even if you’re too young (“Yeah you laugh till your motherfucking as gets drafted”)
He also went out of his way to diss Bis a few times in “Say What You Say”. For the most part, the track is a diss to Jermaine Dupri, who had put himself above Dre as the best producer in the game in an interview. This first part is one I missed at first but it is indeed directed at Bis: “First take, I make mistakes, just keep it / no punches pulled, no punches, that’s weak shit / fake shit, if I ever take shit, I’ll eat shit / wasn’t for him, wouldn’t be shit”. The line that proved to me that it was a diss towards Bis was the ‘no punches’ line. Em would mention Bis’ punchlines in a later diss (mentioned later in this review), practically begging for Bis to use punchlines in his disses towards Em. I looked at it like “No punches? That’s weak shit!”, meaning that if Bis wasn’t using punchlines to diss Em, it would be only looked at as weak. The line that confused me was the last one, “wasn’t for him, wouldn’t be shit”. That could be taken one of three ways: As a reference to himself, saying he wouldn’t be anything without Dre, a producing pioneer in Hip-Hop, backing him with his dope production; a reference to JD, saying that JD wouldn’t even be producing if it wasn’t for Dre’s influence; OR it could’ve been a reference to Canibus, saying that if it wasn’t for his beef with LL Cool J, he would still be just another no-name underground rapper. You can take that however you want, but Em DID go on to mention Bis in the track by name later on: Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this / Amateurs drink veteran piss / from a Dixie cup; if you ever mix me up / or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri, / we’ll rub it in, every club you’re in / we’ll have you blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin’-gain”.
But perhaps his best diss towards Bis from The Eminem Show album was his verse in the song “When The Music Stops”. He constantly refers to his Bis’ known DJ Clue freestyle (the one that begins with ""I speak at frequencies dogs would have trouble hearing / Canibus is the lyrical Version of German engineering."") when you finish the verse, you realize it is a satire of Bis’ freestyle. If you don't understand, let me explain. With the line ""If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battling”, he’s calling out his battle with Bis, saying if they aren’t working together, then they are battling. In the lines “But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake / There's too much on my plate / I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away / and not say what I got to say” he notes how Bis called him a Stan in “U Didn’t Care”, and says he has struggled too much to get to the top of the rap game just to act fake (or let Canibus get away with dissing him). The lines “What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smoking crack?” and “I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground / ‘fore I put some wack shit out” are a reference to the CTHS album as a whole, saying Bis must be smoking crack for taking him as a joke and that he’d kill himself before he’d put out a wack album like it. He goes after Bis with a few challenges, first a physical one, like he did to Everlast and ICP, then challenges him to freestyle, the first reference to Bis’ freestyle I mentioned (""Fuck shooting, I'm just trying to knock his teeth out / fuck with me now bich, let’s see you freestyle”). Em then makes a CLEAR reference to Canibus' freestyle with the line “Motherfucker if you really feeling froggish, leap” This cements the verse as a satire of Canibus' DJ Clue Freestyle, as in that old verse, Bis used the line “You feel like a frog nigga, then jump”. He then says that CTHS was an attempt to diss him and he won’t let him get away with it (“Yo Slim, you gonna let him get away with that? He tried to play you! You can't let him escape with that!”) and then ends his verse saying that CTHS shouldn’t even be considered rap because he’s confusing Hip-Hop with a ‘True Hollywood Story’ (“This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act / when we confuse Hip-Hop with real life, when the music stops”).
The string of Canibus disses continued throughout the months. On a Kay Slay mixtape, Eminem did a freestyle over the beat that would later be used for “Love Me” (from the 8 Mile Soundtrack), making a little Canibus reference: “I live for the love of rap, you crazy? / I’ve made beats for Jay-Z for free, page me / if you need a beat, you Canibus? Then it’s Dre’s fee / For Kay Slay, the fee’s waved”. With still no response from Bis, Em continued on a track from Xzibit's 4th release 'Man Vs Machine' called “Say My Name”, which was a diss track to everyone who had dissed them in the past months. The diss was mainly aimed at Jermaine Dupri, but Em took shots at Bis as well: ""I'd rather have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby / before I let some bitch in a can like Bis cop over me / to do war, and try to bring my crew back down / I’d never stoop to that level to do that now”.
In November, Bis made a return, in a BIG way with his fourth album, “Mic Club: The Curriculum”. Out of the thirteen tracks, two took outright shots at Em. The first was “Dr C, Ph.D.” He took a few shots at his hype man, Proof (“If you ain't got this album you missin' the 'proof’"" and “If you don't like the quality, then talk to me / what the fuck you on a website for you creep? / Punchin' the keys / remember that sound, cause that's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punchin' ya' teeth”), but kept most of the dissing around Em. He lets us know even though he wanted to quit the game, he got back in to take care of Em (""Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood"") and he lets us know that no matter what, he will shine in the limelight of a white emcee (""My nuclear rocket plumes glow against the 'pale' background of the moon""). He later brings up the interview I mentioned from the past, and he tells Em that even though he misinterpreted the meaning of CTHS, he’d know this was an all out attack on him (“I'm spittin' divine, you cant get it twisted this time""). And here are some of the more obvious disses to him:
""Motherfucker you didn't win cause I can't lose
Give the fans a chance to choose? FUCK YOU!
Who's the illest? Who's it really up to?
Rapid fire, you better run for the pacifier
Tie you up and drown you in a saliva quagmire
Till your oxygen expires and ya' lungs dry up
cause you said Bis ain't dope - you a damn liar!""
….
""Yo, I soak that sugarcoated shit in soy sauce
Tell the FCC boss 'Turn that noise off!'
Call Detroit’s mafia boss
Tell 'em 'Yo I gotta' job for you, I want you to bust his balls
Drop him off by Niagara Falls
Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws'""
….
""Kick a rap bitch - if you got the gumption to speak
Stand next to me I might put a lump in ya' meat
Diss you and ya' man, double the beef
to tell you the truth, I thought ya' rebuttal was weak
Round the outside, blah blah, etcetera, etcetera
The body of my literature is bigger than South America
Nigga' look - this is all I got to say
You can suck my P-H-D-I-C-K!""
- Canibus, from “Dr C Ph.D.”
The second diss was on one of Bis’ best songs ever, “Curriculum 101”, in which he dissed the entire rap industry, and also dissed Em in the process. He used a few metaphors to show that in a battle Em could get destroyed. He makes a reference to the battle with LL, when got a tattoo similar to LL's; Canibus is stating that after he defeats Eminem he will put a tattoo of a C on Eminem to really show how bad he won, in contrast to when he got the tattoo of LL when he won that one. He also goes on to call Em ignorant for a couple of reasons; one because his rhymes are plain and simple, while he (Bis) used words that shouldn’t rhyme but made them rhyme anyway, and two because he misunderstood the true meaning of CTHS (which was to satirize the industry), saying he (Em) doesn’t understand what the narrator (Bis) is trying to say about the rap industry.
""Anybody better than Bis MUST be a hoax
Black man, NOPE, What about the Great White Hope?
WHAT?! Man you must be sniffin' great white coke
Don't you know that's like Gary Coleman fightin' the Hulk?!
And still not even quite that close
a great white bitin' ya' rubber dingy boat 50 miles out from the coast
What the fuck is the Mathers wit' you?
I'll beat you black and blue, then I'll probably get a tat of you too
Better yet I'll put a tattoo of me on you
A 10 by 10 ""C"" logo neon blue
The most theatrical MC battle of all time
I rip jackers like you - you know the call sign
The killer cobra that'll hover over Jehovah
in a motorized autogiro with sycamore rotors
Hydrogen peroxide gaseous vapors
Technically these words shouldn't even rhyme off paper
In theory for every soul that can hear me I'mma blaze' em
In practical practice, my style’s even greater
Can't you see what I'm spittin'? Can't you hear the difference?
Compared to me you're energetically inefficient
You need 10 times the enzymes to process one of my rhymes
You gotta rewind every one of my lines
Do you know how to paraphrase?
Can you even understand what the narrator is try to say?""
- Canibus, from “Curriculum 101”
There was also another diss on the Mic Club album ... on the CD itself, there is a word search. In the word search, there are the titles of some of the album tracks (""Curriculum 101"" , ""Poet Laureate"", ""Drama A/T"" for example), his names (""Canibus"" and ""Rip the Jacker"") and even a message to his loyal fanbase (""One Luv To My Fans""). But in paticular, they had four words that werent all together but were so close they could've been connected: ""Battle"" ""Me"" ""Slim"" ""Shady"". They also mention ""Damage Control"", a track that was supposed to be on the album but was taken off at the last minute, along with a few other tracks (These tracks were apparently titled ""You Don't Wanna Battle"", ""Behind the Music"", and ""A Beautiful Mind""); ""Damage Control"" was also rumored to be the full-blown Eminem diss. Go here to see the word search (""Battle"" is highlighted inb Purple and ""Slim Shady"" is highlighted in red ... ""Me"" isn't highlighted, but look to the left of Battle & you'll see it): http://img209.images...rdsearch3il.jpg
At the end of 02/beginning of 03, Em was engaged in another beef, this time with co-owner of The Source, Benzino. In Benzino’s first diss, he referenced Canibus in the lines “You ran to your manager, asked him how to handle this / Five shades darker, motherfucker, you’d be Canibus / No one would care about your complicated rhyme style / Just another backpack rapper out of style”. In Em’s response “Nail in the Coffin”, he didn’t diss Canibus right out but could’ve meant something by it. In these lines he started to change his voice to sound like Canibus, I guess to mock him at the same time: “Here, let me break this shit down / in laymen’s terms for you, just to make sure / that you (imitating Canibus) can understand this when Canibus aint using / to many complicated fuckin’ words for you”. Not a diss to Bis lyric wise, but still, it has to be mentioned.
In 2003, when Bis released two mixtapes to hype people up for his new album, “Rip The Jacker”, one of the tapes included “How Many Emcees”, another track that dissed Eminem, calling him a Stan and referring to the past when Em called Bis' names out in songs for no reason. He also sends a rebuttal to Em's disses towards him from ""When the Music Stops"" from TES. Here, Bis lets him know it wasn’t an attempt at dissing him, but it was a sick concept of parodying the industry. Also when Bis says at the end ""'I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh' / y'all niggas know the rest, don’t fuck with bis"" It’s another rebuttal to WTMS. the ""I'll battle you"" line is from the DJ Clue freestyle and with the second line he is saying that you shouldn’t make a satire of my verse there cause mine is better, they'll remember that one line and know its better than your shit so 'don’t fuck with Bis'.
“Ya know, I think it's just time to be grateful
For every emcee that came through and spit tape-full's of data for you
Every album before this, I made it for you
Nowadays, the truth is I got nothin' to prove
But I heard him call my name a couple times,
in a couple of his rhymes and I thought about it a couple of times
Is he lookin for a response or is he being a jerk?
Or am I just to involved in my work?
I thought to myself, ""why he put my name in his verse""?
When he said I wasn’t ill he just made things worse
That’s when I recognized what Stan was worth,
the only man on earth that could reverse the Cool J curse
I served him, like a nigga without purpose
Constantly taking Rip the Jacker back and forth to my therapist
I wasn’t prepared for this,
People wanna embarrass Bis for reasons that are not really apparent to me yet
What, I can’t get signed because I got mad at a vet?
How could a couple verses have so much anger in 'em?
Don't you know the difference between Rip The Jacker and Bis?
Go use the Pythagoras theory and do the math on this
Add up every multi syllable paragraph
that I’ve managed to average since January 96,
and tell me when you find it you dick ridin' bitch
I’m so sick of you bein skeptical always runnin behind my shit,
tell me the truth, you really think its time that I quit?
You think maybe I could wholesale these rhymes that I spit?
I guess the nicest emcees got tired of Bis
And lied to themselves, like they never relied on Bis
The real rock of the game, people have climed on Bis
Rhyme more sick than anybody out your clique
With thousands of niggas to vouch for that shit
I got a couple bitches too, I make 'em bow to the dick
The album is sick, some Hollywood biography shit,
the difference between ships in bottles, and bottles in ships
Fuckin' wit Rip, they find your fossils at the bottoms of cliffs
Stick 6 mics up your ass even though I doubt it will fit”
- Canibus, from “How Many Emcees”
When the tracklisting to “Rip The Jacker” first was released 2 or 3 months before the album was released, M-Sea-Creasy was rumored to be an Eminem diss (i guess it was to meant something like ""Em, is he Crazy?"") Though he doesn’t go all out at Em like he did on Mic Club, he does talk about what kind of emcee Mr. Mathers really is: ""You cant battle me so you'd rather embarrass me / i maintain dignity in the face of calamity / they reach out they hand at me and talk dishonestly / but i read through there syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky"". You wouldn’t normally think these lines referred to Em but I think it did because in the upcoming months, Em proved this to be true to me. On an Obie Trice mixtape “The Bar is Open” (which was released a week before Obie’s debut “Cheers” was released) It included “Funk Flex Interlude”. In this interlude, Em imitated Funkmaster Flex, saying he will ask the other emcees what they thought about Obie, which led to Em imitating various Emcees saying Obie is tight. The list included Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, and then Canibus. When he did Canibus, he used his imitation Canibus voice to mock him and spit a few lines imitating his style. I guess he did this to let everyone know he hasn’t forgotten about him:

“Yo this is Canibus, the rhyme analyst
I aint feeling Obie Trice, I hope he gets covered and smothered in tarantulas
Before metaphors with reservoir dogs
Before Christ was hung on the cross, before- {Gunfire}

“Get the FUCK outta here!”
- Eminem, “Funk Flex Interlude”
On October 20th of 2003, more shots at Canibus were taken, this time at Eminem's Birthday party. Not much is really known about that happened, but supposedly, Proof got Em to go with him to his favorite club because Canibus was going to battle him there. (NOTE: If you look it up, most stories say Bis was going to battle Em, but the truth is the match was gonna be Bis vs. Proof. Proof even put up posters and flyers saying ""BIG PROOF VS CANIBUS"", which can be seen here: http://img270.images...flyera10pu.jpg). When Em got there, Bis supposedly was waiting for them. Em was eyeballing him, but then Proof got up and revealed the guy was actually just a look-a-like. Em then re-named the rapper Canibitch (again) and sat back as Big Daddy Kane and Doug E Fresh performed a surprise gig for him. But things didnt REALLY heat up until the next month. In November of 2003, the beef ignited in a full force. In that month, while Em was under fire from the Benzino and the media for some basement tapes he made as a teenager for using racial slurs, a number of unreleased Eminem tracks were leaked including a few disses to Benzino and Ja Rule (“Bully” and “Monkey See Monkey Do”), a track from the next D12 album (“Six In The Morning”), two tracks that would make Em’s next album a year later (“Love You More” and “We As Americans”), and finally, the one that matters in this essay, “Canibitch”, the diss track to Canibus.
Some say it was recorded quite a while ago, during the C: True Hollywood Stories era - however no one knows for certain. I say that’s true, it was made during 2002, before TES dropped. Note how he disses Jermaine Dupri and the Pet Shop Boys in the third verse, they made references to Eminem in 2002, and besides, if this track was more recent, he would’ve dissed Benzino or Ja Rule instead. (NOTE: For those who don’t understand the PSB reference, in 2002 they made a track called ""The Night I Fell In Love"", in which a young male fan has a one night romantic encounter with Em. It is obviously about Em, as the fan’s name is Stan and the song references Dr. Dre. PSB singer Neil Tennant said in a statement that if Eminem's music was going to be provocative, he was going to be provocative back. Em never mentioned PSB or spoke on the song other than this, though Dre had reportedly said it was funny). There are two rumors circulating as to how this track leaked. The first is that Benzino managed to get hold of a copy of the song and released it in an attempt to create more problems for Eminem. The second theory is that Eminem leaked it himself to divert attention away from the racist basement tapes. Whichever happened, the first REAL full non-subliminal diss track had surfaced.
The track is over a pop-style beat, almost similar to ""Without Me"". Starting off with borrowing from Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story”, Eminem attacked Canibus in a humorous manner, a way which appeared to be an attempt at winding Canibus up more than straight up insulting him (now you can see how Bis’ lyrics from “M-Sea-Creasy” made more sense to me). Lyrics such as ""99% of my fans are blonde, Bis come on answer me man respond!"" made it clear that Eminem is ready for the beef to be taken to the next level. He went on to attack bis in storytelling fashion; saying how Bis sent letters to him which led to Em going to ‘Canada’ to stop him. The Canada shit was a rumor LL Cool J started, saying Bis was from there originally when he originally was from Jamaica. He referred to him as “Canibitch”, “Stanabis”, and “Canadabis”. The track was pretty nice, as he got at Bis in a funny fashion, but only using childish tactics to attack him. The only real big diss was when he called him a biter. Still, the track was pretty good, good enough to get a response out of Bis:
“So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit, oh Dre wait a minute that's it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border (Lets go!) {*WOOSH!*}
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
{*BOOSH!*} (What was that?) Oh, Jermaine Dupri
Fuck it; keep goin' no time to waste
Wait, back up, and hit him one more time in case (Okay!)
Fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin' to figure out what happened to ‘Jermaine Propane’
""He couldn't have fell of that hard!"" ain't no way!
""What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous
the Canibus turned into a television evangelist""
Plus he raps with his regular voice {*BOOSH!*} {*BOOSH!*}
{*BOOSH!*} {*BOOSH!*} (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted
He kind of smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figure if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife
He's like Kim; he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up 'Bis quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest make my shoulders touch!
DO SOMETHIN'! At least one punchline
C'mon till the meter reads nine, nine,
Nine-ty nine percent of my fans are blonde
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars
Interglacial metaphors from Mars!
'Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs'
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm
from a midget reaches out from under the car
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of Ether
We stomped the bitch and then stomped the bitch again
(Compton!) Detroit bitch talk some shit again!!
STOMP HIM! (Switch feet!) STOMP HIM! (Switch again!)
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him!
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn!)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again”
- Eminem, Third verse of “Canibitch”
For most of 2004, the beef had died down and Bis was absent from the Hip-Hop scene due to his duties in the U.S. Military. He did a few shows and radio appearances to promote the new single “Who Writes The Song”, which he did with Jeymes Samuel, the brother of R&B artist Seal. But finally Bis appeared back in the U.S. with some answers to some questions. On August 22nd 2004, Canibus appeared on the Wake Up Show with Sway and King Tech. When he was asked about Eminem, he was not reluctant to answer questions. When Sway asked when it started, Bis said the phrase ‘the best bump heads at the top’ explained it. He said he was still in the ‘Second Round K.O.’ mania, so he didn’t look at him as anyone important so when they began to bump heads a bit in their tracks. Bis said that Em was aware of his style and liked his music, and Bis said after hearing him, he liked his music too. But basically, Bis blamed it all on communication problems.
Sway then mentioned the “Canibitch” diss track, and Bis said that when he was in the army, someone played the track for him there. Bis explained that the track didn’t start a fire in him, because he felt Em didn’t really say anything worthwhile. He said Em ripped Everlast, Jermaine Dupri, and Benzino, but the “Canibitch” track was a weak attempt, and hardly an all out assault on him. He felt that Em was just taking jabs at Bis, since Bis took jabs at him first. Bis said he’s more interested in ‘fusing relationships’ then battling, but he would retaliate if Em dissed him. Bis then said that a week before, an intern from Shady Records called him up and asked him if he wanted to battle someone at Riggs Morales' ""Fight Klub"", which is a place in New York where any emcee can battle any emcee, regardless of whether they are signed or unsigned. He later got an e-mail from someone (most likely a fan) saying that Em was the one that wanted to battle at Fight Klub. Bis said he’s been contemplating the Fight Klub thing, and stated to Em “We don't have to draw it back to '8 Mile' but if you want to draw it back to '8 Mile', I’ll be right there with a smile on my face”. Nothing more ever evolved out of the Fight Klub challenge, though it is rumored that Em wasn't up for the challenge when Mic Club called Shady back and challenged Em to an actual battle. Either way, in an interview with AllHipHop.com from April of 2005, Bis had said ""the battle was over"" for him:
AllHipHop.com: With the battle circuit heating up, and the Fight Klub putting up a million dollars as prize money for an upcoming battle, would you consider battling again?
Canibus: No. The battle is over for me. I'm free to make music and elevate the art. It's time to rebuild.
Em was never asked about the beef that much but Canibus would be asked about it in nearly every interview. In some interviews, he gave Em props but still wouldn't put him above himself (in one interview from 2003, Bis had said this about Em: ""His wordplay is phenomenal. His rhythm is impeccable. His mind is sick and twisted which is a good thing and his star quality is absolutely explosive. Now having said that... do I think he's better than RTJ? FUCK NO!""). It was obvious Bis was fed up with being asked about it, as in one 2003 interview he had started responding sarcastically, saying that he and Em ""love each other"", and then saying ""We meet at 3:30 am every thursday and battle it out one on one-no cameras, media, or witnesses. Just like Rocky and Apollo Creed!"". But I remember one interview that not many people know about that caught my eye. Let me explain. On a canibus fan site known as Canibusworld.com, it was figured out that Bis had been secretly posting on the site under the name 'Da Watcha'. One of the site's mods, theTRUTH, had set up a Q&A session with Bis before he left. This took place in September of 2004, one month after the Wake Up Show interview mentioned in the previous paragraph. In this questionare, Bis had said that due to the events that happpened between him and Em in the past, he took the song ""Stan"" personally, among other things:
""3. What was the reasoning/meaning behind CTHS?
Ironically, I take pleasure in seeing what it means to you all. I sometimes picture that there is a gauntlet of ""pissed off people"" that I have to run through about CTHS. In the songs that were recorded around that time I mildly remember quotes here and there about my mental/musical/emotional state. Statements that came from me, of course. I was disillusioned with the relationship between what I wanted and what I already had. I wanted Eminem to know that I took Stan personally because of what transpired between us both. I will come clean and tell you that I played the ""asshole role"" and hurt him deeply. If it's of any consolation to you I was crushed 10 fold when I heard STAN. Yes. Besides the fact that I heard the record maybe a couple hundred short of 1 million times. Even then I knew that my opportunity to make things right with Em was nil. I was off of universal. EMI had lapsed my publishing deal and I had recorded material to seek another deal. @ the time it seemed lucrative to release an LP independently as I had seen with Ca$h Money, Master Percy, and Daz (who was eating like a mad dog off that shit) as per my conversation with Wendy Day. She was encouraging and helpful to me. I was later introduced to Louis Lombard who release the ""Priesthood"" album which happened to be a name that we (Bis & Killah Priest) coined drunk off some Gramarne (I don't drink anymore). Louis had explained some things to me I had never heard before and thus CTHS was born. CTHS was my 3rd release. My 4th and 5th were lyrical beasts. The CTHS-Mic Club-RTJ trilogy is undeliberate. They are independent of each other. The only link between them is me. I wonder if what happened at the video shoot and some of the following events (the tour bus meeting @ the Syracuse NY show, the show at the Long Island Coliseum, the cold face off at Cheung King) were just buttons being snapped up on a shirt I was destined to wear. I was still entangled in the backlash of Battling ""L"". The Beef II DVD shows that my music career was more of an unplanned publicity stunt for ""L"" than it was for what I came in the fuckin' game to do in the first place. I was like the ""wrestler of the week"" or something. I have been unable to make amends with L because he acts like he hates me. Even my mother thinks he's sexy (like he says) but she don't feel him cause she knows the effect that 2nd Round KO shit had on my life. One-Hit-Blunder. I was a champ in Hip Hop for a hot sec. I respected L enough to get tatted up and give him a run for his skully. I revered him enough now to say he changed my life for the better because I found purpose. Maybe my effect on Hip Hop helped others find purpose also. Canibus ain't a lifestyle, Canibus is the 9th mile / Sike, I'm just playin', but I bet I made ya' smile. Read: It was all in the Name of Hip Hop. Nobody really got hurt. Honest to God. If I can look back and say that I had a good time, how can LL or Eminem say they had a bad one?"".
The Q&A session was split into two parts and this was from part two. Go here (http://www.canibus-central.com/site/media/interviews/008.php) to read part 2 and go here (http://www.canibus-central.com/site/media/interviews/007.php) to read part 1.
No real attempts have been made by one to outright diss the other since then, though it seems that they would continue to take subliminal at each other. Whether this is true or not is unknown as the disses in this paragraph are pure speculation, but I’mma say it anyway, since it IS possible. First off, in a track titled ""I Wish U Would"" that featured Chino XL and Royce Da 5'9 (from the Sway and Tech album ""Back 2 Basics""), a lot of people speculated that a good amount of Bis’ verse was aimed at Eminem, as he proclaims that he will ""Beat (him) up with (his) fans around"", saying ""I don’t give a fuck if you're a star or not”. He also says ""Fuck who you roll with, your man's a clown nigga"" and many believed that referenced Dr. Dre (it also could’ve referenced 50 Cent) and the one line that convinced everyone it was directed at Em, the line they think referenced G-Unit (the Guerilla Unit): “Hang around guerrillas/gorillas, your fragrance becomes ape-ish”. Now as for the Eminem ‘shot’ at Bis, it was supposedly on his 2004 album “Encore”, in the track “Never Enough”. A lot of people think these lines refer to Bis: “Sooner or later, you haters are all gonna face me / And when you face me with all that shit you’ve been saving / to say to me, you had all this time to think about it now / don’t pussy out and try to about face me / Cause I’ve been ‘patiently waiting’ for the day / We finally meet in the same place to see…”. The logic is this: he's basically saying that Bis has had time to come up with content for the battle bein' that he was overseas and that Em has been waiting for him to come back. Now that Bis has been back a bit he seems to want to squash and move on. As I said before, Bis said he had heard rumors that Em was gonna come out and face him. I think Em is addressing the issue about Bis not accepting the challenge. Plus, the ""about face me"" line could be taken as a reference to Bis having been in the army.
In the beginning of 2005, however, it seemed the beef wouldn't hype up as Bis would continue to give Em props. A new Canibus mixtape titled “The Virtuvian Man” containing some recent Kay Slay freestyles, as well as some leaked material that was supposed to be for his next album, ""Hip-Hop For Sale"". The mixtape had Bis taking a slightly different route then his recent ‘Rip the Jacker’ style, dumbing down his large vocabulary while still dropping some ill lyrics. On the track “Dear Academy” where he shouts out all his friends who made it in the industry, like Common for example (“Nominated for being underrated / we ‘Made a Name for Ourselves’ but I guess Common was the only one who made it”), he mentioned Em and D12 in the second verse, as he pretended to be in the audience of an award show, whispering in awe about all the people he’s sitting with: “D12, me and them struck a pose man / with Slim Shady, yo this must be an omen!”. In the third verse, he makes another reference to Eminem, one that could be taken either way (as a diss or showing props): “I’m in the game now, I ran 8 Miles / I ain’t the same old nigga with the same style”. Most of the material from that bootleg recorded for ""Hip-Hop for Sale"", including that ""Dear Academy"" track, made it onto the album when it was released in November 2005.
A few days after the Virtuvian Man was leaked, another Canibus song was leaked where he addressed the beef between him and Eminem directly. THe production on it was similar to the production on CTHS but Bis' lyrics were fire. Being an unreleased Mixtape verse, it didn't have an official title, but ""The Ballad"" was the tag title given to it (you'll see why in a second). It seemed to be an old song made in the UK from 2001 or 2002, as he says in the middle of it ""I'm working on my fourth album"", which was 2002's Mic Club. In it, he references his beef with LL Cool J (""I'm Illmatic like Nas and Stillmatic like Escobar / No I'm not still at it with Todd / Don't blame me, it aint my fault, it never was / Before I even knew him, I already had a buzz / But that was then, and this is now / Bis been rippin' it down since the day he came out"") and talks about Alica Keyes, which shows how the ""infatuation with Alicia Keyes"" line in ""Poet Laureate 2"" makes sense (""I wanna give Alicia Keyes a kiss / compose a ballad and just make her fiend for Bis"") but the beginning of it is about his beef with Eminem. He starts out by referencing an advertisement for CTHS that he put in The Source in 2002 that had a picture of 'Stan' and Eminem. He says he did it for 'a little controversy'; he goes on to call Eminem's rhymes ""very weak"". At the end of the song, he calls Em out and tells him if hes going to diss him, he needs to diss him outright instead of the few times he did subliminally on the Eminem Show. In the outro, he says something to the effect ""I'll take you on mano e mano"", showing that Bis was ready for this beef to be taken to the next level. Here are the lines about Em:
""I'm about 8,000 miles away from home
Thinking about the throne I got my eyes fixated on
I just put an add in The Source to cause a little controversy
Came from doing a concert in Jersey last Thursday
A kid said Eminem wanted to hurt me
He called my name out more than a few times and tried to embarrass me
His rhyme is very weak; I didn't know he had words for me,
I bet he's probably never even heard of me
Ever since I met Stan, he took it kinda personally
It didn't even occur to me he was involved personally
With Stan earlier than me, now he's perturbed at me
I seen him on the street last week he cursed at me
He told me him and D12 were gonna murder me
And anytime that I'm ready that he's got a verse for me
Damn, I didn't know he was that thirsty for me
I guess he ain't the only emcee that's nervous of me
There aint a person in the game wit more courage than me
From France to Germany they call me the merchant of beef""
....
""Damn, i can write raps, I'm good at it aint i?
Niggas call my name out, cuz they want the mic back
but i raise the price so high that in fact
The market is collapsed and niggas don't know how to act
I guess the world's chaos is spinning over the raps
They make you sign a contract, and con you out of your tracks
Don't act like you don't know Bis
The man with the organic tongue and the golden spit""
....
""I'm an extremist, when I'm on some MC shit,
and after this you could never not believe in Bis
Terry stone, UK clique, keepin it thick
Use my name motherfucker when you speakin' to Bis""
- Canibus, ""Exclusive Freestyle (a.k.a The Ballad)""
As time went on, Canibus seemed to drop more supposed references to Em. In late 2005, Bis signed with Head Trauma Records and hooked up with Phoenix Orion to form the duo Cloak and Dagger, who would go on to drop an album titled ""Def Con Zero"". In a exclusive mixtape freestyle, Bis went on to promote DCZ, and managed to confirm that a sequel to ""Mic Club: The Curriculum"" was being made (""People say 'Canibus, what's up with you? / When you coming out with something new?' / Curriculum 2 coming soon, don't even trip my nigga""). In this freestyle, he dropped a few lines that could've been making reference to Em, as well as the supposed Fight Klub battle: ""I charge 500 G's or better for Fight Klub"" and ""Detonate mines, run '8 Miles' 8 times"". On the DCZ album, there was a song called ""Close to Me"", where Bis said a few lines that could've been attacking Em. First, he said a line that referenced ""Like Toy Soldiers"", the song where Em attempted to squash beef with Ja Rule and Benzino: ""Wake up, smell the roses, the fuckin' toy soldiers / have Styrofoam shoulders and can't stay focused"". Bis also said ""Battle? Watch the faggot bail"", which could've been a reference to Em supposedly bailing on the Fight Klub battle.
Bis released three albums in 2005: ""Mind Control"" (originally recorded in 2001, but remained unreleased due to Bis' disputes with a former label), the previously mentioned ""Hip-Hop for Sale"" (which included a few new tracks as well as some tracks from the Virtuvian Man Bootleg), and the previously mentioned ""Def Con Zero"". He also released a mixtape on his website titled ""Mic Club Master Vol. 1"", which was made up of a few new songs that Bis had recorded while in the army, as well as some old classics. One of the new songs. On one of the new songs ""Yeng Meng, it sounded to me like Bis was going off on someone. Is it possible that he was going at Em? Maybe, as the song's hook first sounded like he was speaking on the constant rumors that spread through the streets: ""Niggas runnin' around like, ""what did he say?"" / All day, everyday, ""what did he say?"" / Everybody want to know, ""what did you say?"""". As Bis starts into his verse, it sounds like he's directing his attention to a certain someone. It's likely that it could be about Em, but more likely that it's about his fickle fanbase: ""Yo, I don't want to waste no lyrics talkin' about you / just let my body die and rot in hell why don't you / You asked the same question, I already told you / I'm a lyricist, I do what I'm supposed to do / You ever wonder what Hip-Hop would have been without me? / I'm six albums deep, somebody is thinkin' about me / whether it's good or bad, yo, I can't control it / a nigga's opinion belongs to him; I can't own it"". Even if he didn't get at Em in a negative way in this song, there was definitely a reference to Em in that interview taking back what he said about Bis being dope: ""Even the best confessed, at some point in they life, they said / that I'm the illest, but now they want you to forget"".
As time went on, both parties seem to have let the beef die down. The difference between the two is while Em's mainstream fan base could care less if he gets at Bis, Bis' fanbase still want him to rip Em to shreds. In 2007, Bis released a new record titled ""For Whom the Beat Tolls"" and did a few shows in the U.S. to promote the record. At one particular show at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood CA, Bis let a fan in the audience get on the mic, to which that fan proceeded to shout ""It's all about Canibus, fuck Eminem!"" to which the whole crowd started cheering. Bis wasted no time in trying to peacefully resolve the situation: ""Hold up! Aiiyo Em... Em, or whoever, when you see it man, don't get tight at me, he said it!"". He continued on, and with one sentence, Bis pretty much confirmed that 'the most theatrical emcee battle of all time' was over: ""But look though! I ain't on that shit, I ain't beefin with them niggas. I'mma do MY shit!"". The entire incident can be viewed here:
Here's what's been going on for the two emcees as of October 2007:
Since the release of ""For Whom the Beat Tolls"" in June, Canibus has split ways with his label Mic Club Music and longtime partner Louis Lombard. He is currently signed to Waste Management Records, a label owned by Def Squad member K-Solo. There has been no news about any new Canibus records, though a few rumors have started spreading lately; the rumors range from him retiring to him signing with Murder Inc.
As for Eminem, he spent all of 2005 dropping guest verses for his artists on the Shady/Aftermath label, as well as a few that weren't on the label. It was rumored in July of 05 that Em was retiring from the rap game, but he later dismissed these rumor as being false. According to Em, he was just ""taking a long break"" from rapping, focusing more on his production for other artists. At the end of 2005, Em released ""Curtain Call"", a greatest hits compilation containing all his popular singles as well as three new songs. In Mid 2006, Em decided to extend his leave of absence from music after the tragic death of his best friend Proof and divorcing from his wife Kim (whom he remarried in early 06). At the end of 2006, Em dropped ""The Re-Up"", a compilation album that featured new tracks from him as well as newer artists on his Shady Records label. The rumors of a new Eminem album have been running rampant, and most people believe we will see a new album released sometime in 2008.
But what’s next battle wise for the two emcees? No one really knows. You can’t evaluate where the battle will escalate from here, but you can make your predictions. My prediction is that this will never go down officially, on stage or on wax. When Em took his extended leave of absence from the mic, there was is NO chance of this beef ever happening. In my personal opinion, the only way this beef would ever heat up again is if Bis decided to pull a Jay-Z and drop a massive diss track that’ll start a fire in Em (the same way Jigga did to Nas with “Takeover”). Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem that will happen, as Bis has expressed no more interest in battling anyone, let alone Em (""I'm more interested in fusing relationships"", ""The battle is over for me"", ""I ain't beefing with them"", etc.). As long as this beef as gone on, you can not come up with a clear clean-cut winner because there hasn’t been enough full-fledged diss tracks exchanged to decide that. You can speculate with all the subliminal tracks mentioned in this essay (some of which possibly aren’t even intended as disses), and when you do, it looks pretty even and the battle could go either way. But if you wanna REALLY determine a winner, you can’t, cause when you get RIGHT down to it, the only real full-fledged diss track was “Canibitch”, and that song wasn’t meant to be released, it leaked more than a year after it was recorded. If you want my opinion, with all these songs, all these disses, subliminal and outright, this battle is nothing more than a DRAW.
But is that really the end of this battle? Will “the most theatrical emcee battle of all time” never go down? You can’t tell, but never say never cause old feuds never really die, they are just buried away for a while. But someday, it is bound to be brought up, whether by Em or Bis or their fans or interviewers. So in the words of Em himself, ""stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo"".1Embed"

Your Lips Are Movin',Anastasia Hill,"4 ContributorsThe Race (Megamix) Lyrics
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

Pimp gon' be eatin' good noodles every day
Bitch I'm drawin' doodles, Tay-K paint the way
Choppa tear your dudies into fish fillet
I woke up too moody, who gon' die today?
Shoot a fuckboy in his motherfuckin' face
We cookin' up, boy, you don't wanna go dat way
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades
Gotta go dat way, boy you not gon' be happy
I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my .9 with sub-compaction
You might also like
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
I'm gon' shoot bitch, without a debate
I'm gon' shoot, you can see it in my face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race

See it in my mothafuckin' face
Free Tay-K, man
We love 

Suck a freak, I was tryin' get the cake
Hunnid deep, we gon' pull up to ya place
Fuck a week, I be ballin' every day
Fuck the cheese, I be tryin' get the face
In the kitchen water whippin' in the 
Lotta' money, Lotta' hoes, Lotta' hate
Pockets swoll', lotta' shows, different states
Used ride in the trappy with no plates
I ain't have it then, but bitch I got it now
Shout out  make them dance, Bobby Brown
Pew, pew, pew, pew
Love that gun sound
Talkin' shit, just gon' get you gunned down
Ho its Zoovie I don't think you want no action
You ain't trappin' no, nigga you be cappin'
We was down we was tryna' make it happen
Hoes in the four door get the lappin'
You ain't on my level you ain't on my bracket
Man that nigga dead put him in the casket
I just spent 5k on a jacket
And I still like my bitch a lil' ratchet
I know you pussies talkin' bout me very day
Fuck a beef nigga this ain't bout a chain
If you a smoke why you ain't let it spray
If I'ma joke why you ain't come to play
Niggas talkin' big 40s every day
Call his bitch big shawty on my waist
Now this nigga goin' down, come outside
Catch me on the 12 I don't ever hide
How you a gangsta if you motherfuckin' 2
Boy stop playin' you too motherfuckin' old
Ay I bet you wish you made better decisions
You lil' bitch
I ain't say nothin' you was playin' the victim
You lil' bitch
Itchy boys I don't fall under pressure
The first million that I saw invest
Ay playin' chess but my couple was checkers
Ay on the jet tell this nigga to catch up
Fuck a  put the lawyers on the case
Bitch you too weak so I ain't kicked it with my gang
Ay and my bro ain't say no motherfuckin' names
Free my bros off the motherfuckin' cage
Shit be crazy feel like I ain't never change
Quad told me get this guap while you can
Niggas wanna' see Wap in the jail
Ay I'm twelve hunnid you can see it in my face
It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck, out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today
All that fake gangbanging get you slayed
Think you hard, you get robbed for your chain
Nigga snatch my chain, that's a man down, mayday
In a race bitch, always first place
Nah for real bitch, first place always
Shout out Diego Money, Mitch, and Lil Jay
SKTDDG, that's always
Free Big Reese, they're tryna give him more days
Never been shot and truthfully I do not want to
If she not fuckin', boy respect that she don't want you
Say fuck the bitch and keep it movin' 'fore it haunt you
Don't fuck many, circle tighter than a bantu, let's get it
Hate these niggas, they fake weird and they fake emo
I'm 'bout my money, give a fuck about your friendzone
These niggas tryna clique it up and run against me
I have respect but now it's nothing else against me
Had that truck buck, I turned it to a tar heel
She ride dick like a bike, wheelie back wheel
They say don't fuck your homie bitch, that's a no-no
I took my old homie bitch and kicked it dolo
Told my nigga's mom I'm sorry, yeah he still broke (bye bye)
But buddy got up in his feelings so it's fuck bro
She pop six, now she ride dick like a Volvo
And snorting way more lines than a barcode
I'm not buckin' but I'm ready with the arsenal
Hit his chest, now his name in an article
It's Young Boat, put a nigga in they place
Rich as fuck out the window, free Tay-K
First show I did I got less than 10K
Saw Tay-K, now he who he is today
See it in my mother-fuckin' face (Lil' Boat)

Coming at you with rapid fire
Boutta make these other wack niggas retire
They old and soiled like milk that's expired
It's the man, Finny, making girl's pussy transpire (ooh)
Yes, the one and only of Flickr fame
They tryna knock Finny off, get him out the game
Cause I don't like faggots, and that's a shame
I'm the greatest, I'm so hard to be tamed
Licking me, making me hard like Bedrock
She put her lips on like she whistling, Matlock
Tonuge movin' round like it's dancing, Baylock
They found Bruce's porn, guess he should've had a padlock
The ting go skrra, like I'm Stephen Paddock
I'll make you disappear, clear key, glasscock
Onomatopoeia, that's a knock knock
My guy, that's a quick walk to Bangkok
Chicken nuggets, with a side of cheese mac (mac cheese)
Take it all, loving chicken cause I'm black (I'm black)
Shouldn't be hungry, Cheetos is my snack (that's my snack)
I just ate, they call me Truck Attack (Manhattan)
Y'all niggas super gay for taking a knee (niggers gay)
Y'all waiting for niggas to skeet (skeet skeet)
In your mouths, y'all suck dick for free (do it for free)
And the nigga, don't look like no she (not a tranny)
Y'all better run, Cory's in the house (blaow blaow)
Stick my fingers right up her damn blouse (right up her blouse)
With my nut, in her mouth, I'mma douse (yummy)
If she swallow, she might be my spouse

F-f-fuck a beat I was tryna beat a dick (yeah)
I be fucking eyeballs when I fuck my bitch (oh yeah)
Beat it up where she nut on my lips
My dick is so big holy shit (oh my god)
Shut up bitch now slob on my knob (okay yeah)
Shoot my nut then I got to go mob (skrt skrt)
E-e-eatin ass cause it tastes really good (mhf-mhf)
Use a spoon cause you really know I should (ohh)
When I suck yeah its all on your toes (uh)
Let me put my dick on your ankles (please)
Oh that’s your ear no that’s a hole
Imma eat shit straight from the bowl (oh my god)
Hello female, what is your name? (Susan)
Cool, get on your knees and give me brain (okay)

F-f-fuck a beat I was tryna suck a fart (suck that fart)
But I ain’t sucked that fart bitch I fucked a shark (fuck that shark)
Crush a xan' where’d it go up my ass (prrrt)
My dick itchy like I rolled it in grass (why my dick itchy?)
Pack a dip then I spit on her thigh (hrrr ptui)
I can’t see with this nut in my eye (eugh)
Ate a bug then I threw up on your bitch (eurgh)
I want that bug back b-b-bitch

Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
I'm gon' shoot bitch, without a debate
I'm gon' shoot, you can see it in my face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race

Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our ...

Fuck the , little gram by the case
New Bugatti, who wanna race
Black Barbie, make her come to the base
Pink pussy, pink slips in my safe
(Yeah) You switched your rollie face, heard it was fake
Uh, I put stones in my goyard foretaste
(Yeah) No receipts, the feds want that case
Cash Money, I still need that from baby (Millions)
I just spent 80k on little baby (Ooh)
I just bought out my deal now I'm Swayze
Uh, tours in Tokyo my chains is on eagle
In Dubai, where weed puff illegal
New bitch, they think it's the sequel
Wolfgang, cook up like Lil B do
Uh, Moo Sho, 
Seven years later, dinner plates is still Versace
When I'm in Saint Martin, say the floor cold like Tommy
Palace with shawties and I work like 
Wrist rocky, I got all the clout
Niggas, watch me
Cause they bitch watching
Top models top me, top rappers follow
I'm in São Paulo, Brazil getting swallowed
Fuck that , little gram by the case
New Bugatti, young sold the wraith
Black Barbie, make her come to the base
Pink pussy, pink slips in my safe
(Yeah) You switched your rollie face, heard it was fake
Uh, I put stones in my goyard foretaste
Uh, no receipts, the feds want that case
Cash Money, I still need that from baby (Yeah)

Rico Rico
You can see it in my motherfuckin' face

I just (I just) beat another gun case
Now I can do shows out the United States
I got shit locked and ain’t a mother fucker safe
Paper on paper like a nigga tryna trace
Gorillas with me and they love me, they gone spray
But imma say i pray this cake don’t turn my apes up into snakes
Let me find out I will not miss you I’m not case
‘Cus I’m gone shoot you right up in yo fucking face
Fuck niggas always run they mouth and wanna hate
I’m taking all them bitches out elimidate
Get out of line I bet this 40 set em straight
This bitch got kick, free my nigga Kevin Gates
My gun be singing, it be spitting like it’s Drake
Mashed potato on the barrel, then i split after it bake
Campaign, champagne when this 30 pop off
40 bang, blood dripping down his clothes Scott Hall
And you know I’m squeezing triggers until all my ops fall
For life I got bars, I’m not Ray, I’m not Claude
And my broski and em up next, like a Lonzo I ball
Eating good and I put that on everything, hot sauce
Don’t act like I’m not god, hope my flow is not flawed
Every bar is rock hard, bitch my lyrics drop jaws
Ever since I was a pup, I knew I’d be top dog
Man you rappers not raw, hang it up like dropped calls
Bitch I’m the truth, don’t run no game, you can’t finesse
Make moves like chess, up on these squares just call me fresh
Green like the Jets, slid through New York, balled like the Mets
Yo bitch she wet, she peeped the dick print in my sweats
Was down to try and count me out, just like a ref
Bitch I’m self made, I’m CEO, Bitch I cut checks
Came in the game and started killing, Thomas Chef
Cop my first 30, you couldn’t tell me i wasn’t Steph
Panda express, been cook cats up like the chef
I was Smith N Wesson, I been freaky Jazzy like he Jeff
And I ain’t perfect, oh yeah I’d been in trouble before
Up in the jungle with bro, we used to hustle and flow
Ain’t shit to catch a body, I done caught a couple before
Man it’s the drug deal killers still juggle the flow
Up in a rental with pistol and a bundle of dough
Man I been flexing on these niggas since N.W.O
Bad bitch on me, wanna put that monkey on me like Aladdin
I’m flying, my dick gigantic, she rode the pipe like an addict
She bounce on it like a rabbit, she scream my name, got it tatted
Pulled it out, opened her mouth, put my wood in like a cabin
She a savage, anytime, any place I nicknamed her Janet
Blew on me Orlando Magic, that’s getting top like a attic
Boy yo ass don’t want no beef
Don’t want no smoke, don’t want no static
Tulley on my Gucci belt, tot that hammer like a mechanic
When these clips leave everybody wet, you ain’t watching Titanic
Reeking havoc, heaters blasting, they sound like they speaking spanish
I get busy with this 50, it singing like Lenny Kravitz
Blow a hole in you and yo bro like you was Goku and Raditz
Bitch you average, I be spazzing, I’m major pain on you maggots
FGE we keep green on us like we was from planet Namek
May 20th, pray for the devil on the way
Rap god bitch, I just did the race (easy)

I cracked a wood and dropped an eighth (dropped an eighth)
I took that blunt right to the face (smoking dope)
What you re-up on I smoke that in a day
Burning fat woods get them swishers out my face
Yeah they know my name but they don't know bout me (don't know me)
If you don't know me then don't ask me bout the streets
Yeah he talking slick but he don't want no beef (he a bitch)
Bitch my gun expensive and that talk is cheap (pow pow)
I keep a glizzy right up on my waist (on my waist)
Cause before I die I rather catch a case
Don't make me shoot you in your motherfucking face (pow pow)
Let out shots and then I do the race (skrrt skrrt)
He a mouse, he be squeaking to police (you a bitch)
When we catch him we gon put him on TV (boom boom)
Fuck what he saying he only savage on a beat (fucking phoney)
Big-ass 40's shells knock him off his feet (boom boom)
I got that top, now I'm done, you can keep that bitch (jeez)
Running with that bag, pockets full of blue strips (them bands)
Flexing with that pack, we run up in your shit (gimme that)
Rob the plug now we taking all his licks (fucking goofy)
Fuck that Quali, bitch I'm leaning off this Wockhardt (wock wock)
So much purple in my Sprite, bitch I'm a wockstar (wock wock)
And I'm walking in Balmains not no Rockstars
I put a thirty in a toaster like a pop-tart (thirty thirty)
Yeah they know my name but they don't know bout me (nah)
If you don't know me then don't ask me bout the streets (bitch)
Yeah he talking slick but he don't want no beef (hell no)
Bitch my gun expensive and that talk is cheap
I keep a glizzy right up on my waist (glizzy glizzy)
Cause before I die I rather catch a case

If you loafing in that prison then I'm sending that kite
Whatchu think I bought this gun for? I ain't tryna fight
Try to diss me in a song, I bet my shooter get you right
If you talking, we pop up, we clapping, no need for that acting
Say my niggas in love with that action, tote pistols in traffic
Got it on me, run up and I'm sparkin'

Traveler,Rio,"9 ContributorsHabits Lyrics
I saw things I couldn't imagine
I turned my mind right into a palace
I told my Mom, ""Soon you gon' be happy""
Man, this shit took a long time, I'm still not happy

Bad Boy,Madame sister,"5 ContributorsBrenda’s Baby Lyrics
Brenda’s baby is grown
While I’m out here watching a throne
Trying to reach thugging teens with a poem
Maybe go from unknown to people saying Stimuli done blown
The eff up guess what
I just sound like a clone I’m sorry
Spitting it raw but shifting my course
It’s been 15 years without Mister Shakur
And if you think about the shit that he saw
I hope the pictures I draw can come close
‘Cause I give you my all
It’s real
It’s funny to hear my flow
Never dreamed I would be getting money to bear my soul
Thinking bout the times and the hoods where we reside
Shit is wild Brenda’s baby’s like twenty years old
Pac thought the world was cursed in '91
Felt the adverse of the slogan live by the gun
I’m still stuck in this game he tried to run
Well he did kind of run it I’m sad his time is done
But the issues he was bringing up, stories that he gave
Are the issues still facing us
Call us mental slaves
I ain't talking just blacks, in the hood we all the same
The government sees statistics so Brenda’s kid has no name
Father is her cousin
Grandmother punks her
She hears plenty stories bout being left in a dumpster
So she’s not supposed to make it
The ghetto should take her under
You expect her on the pole or something since nobody loved her
Mama died prostituting
No one heard her cries
Pac was busy yelling Hit Em Up
When she was turning five
We was worried bout the coastal war
Picking choosing sides
Bad Boy made noise
Then our biggest heroes died
It was like we lost the Malcolm and Martin
Of our young generation they was just getting started
No arrests even made when there’s rappers that’s targeted for assassination
They ain’t even pressing no charges it’s messed up
You might also likeThe country is falling, disease is spreading
My people are dying, economy’s hurting the seeds are embedded
With pain and desire to try to get the cheese the bread
The papers, the dollars, the politics are keeping us dead
And the labels are losing and Youtube is winning
The students are stupid, the teachers ain’t getting no pay so they missing
The president’s different, he tells us his vision
But then television is probably killing the minds of the children
The brothers are niggas the sisters are bitches the rappers are liars
The mamas are babies the babies are crying
You hear it, thee alarm clocks are going off
Y’all not listening, little girls are showing off
They big tits and they asses
The shit’s sickening, pastors are stick pricking the catholic little kids
And I’m rapping this slick shit while the
Haters are stabbing the teens are slicing
America’s chuckling at us, while we rocking our ice and
We think we get money, we making it rain and we paying the strippers we popping the bottles the owners get richer
They owning the clubs, and they owning the drugs and they owning the liquor We taking the shots and they keeping the picture
It’s real, the music is weaker the albums ain’t selling
We talking bout nothing the albums ain’t selling
We talk about hustling, clapping and selling
And half of us was really clapping or selling I used to rap like you I was sevenEmbed"

Like Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions.

That’s it. Hung Chung Egglyfella now speak he tell numptywumpty top-sawys belongahim pidgin. Secret things other persons place there covered not. How you fell from story to story like a sagasand to lie. Enfilmung infirmity. On the because alleging to having a finger a fudding in pudding and pie. And here’s the witnesses. Glue on to him, Greevy! Bottom anker, Noordeece! And kick kick killykick for the house that juke built! Wait till they send you to sleep, scowpow! By jurors’ cruces! Then old Hunphy-dunphyville’ll be blasted to bumboards by the youthful herald who would once you were. He’d be our chosen one in the matter of Brittas more than anarthur. But we’ll wake and see. The wholes poors riches of ours hundreds of manhoods and womhoods. Two cents, two mills and two myrds. And it’s all us rangers you’ll be facing in the box before the twelfth correctional.

Don Gouverneur Buckley’s in the Tara Tribune, sporting the insides of a Rhutian Jhanaral and little Mrs Ex–Skaerer-Sissers is bribing the halfpricers to pray for her widower in his gravest embazzlement. You on her, hosy jigses, that’ll be some nonstop marrimont! You in your stolen mace and anvil, Magnes, and her burrowed in Berkness cirrchus clouthses. Fummuccumul with a graneen aveiled. Playing down the slavey touch. Much as she was when the.fancy cutter out col-lecting milestones espied her aseesaw on a fern. So nimb, he said, a dat of dew. Between Furr-y-Benn and Ferr-y-Bree. In this tear Vikloe vich he lofed. The smiling ever. If you pulls me over pay me, prhyse! A talor would adapt his caulking trudgers on to any shape at see. Address deceitfold of wovens weard. The wonder of the women of the world together, moya! And the lovablest Lima since Ineen MacCormick MacCoort MacConn O’Puckins MacKundred. Only but she is a little width wider got. Be moving abog.

Scapu-lars, beads and a stump of a candle, Hubert was a Hunter, chemins de la croixes and Rosairette’s egg, all the trimmings off the tree that she picked up after the Clontarf voterloost when O’Bryan MacBruiser bet Norris Nobnut.

We could kiss him for that one, couddled we, Huggins? Sparkes is the footer to hance off nancies. Scaldhead, pursue! Before you bunkledoodle down upon your birchentop again after them three blows from time, drink and hurry. The same three that nursed you, Skerry, Badbols and the Grey One. All of your own club too. With the fistful of burryberries were for the massus for to feed you living in dying. Buy bran biscuits and you’ll never say dog. And be in the finest of companies.

Tem for Tam at Timmotty Hall! We’re been carried away. Beyond bournes and bowers. So we’ll leave it to Keyhoe, Danelly and Pykemhyme, the three muskrat- eers, at the end of this age that had it from Variants’ Katey Sherratt that had it from Variants’ Katey Sherratt’s man for the bonnefacies of Blashwhite and Blushred of the Aquasancta Liffey Patrol to wind up and to tells of all befells after that to Mocked Majesty in the Malincurred Mansion.
So you were saying, boys? Anyhow he what?
So anyhow, melumps and mumpos of the hoose uncommons, after that to wind up that longtobechronickled gettogether thanksbetogiving day at Glenfinnisk-en-la-Valle, the anniver-sary of his finst homy commulion, after that same barbecue bean — feast was all over poor old hospitable corn and eggfactor, King Roderick O’Conor, the paramount chief polemarch and last pre-electric king of Ireland, who was anything you say yourself be — tween fiftyodd and fiftyeven years of age at the time after the socalled last supper he greatly gave in his umbrageous house of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was’nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly good reason that he was still such as he was the eminent king of all Ireland himself after the last preeminent king of all Ireland, the whilom joky old top that went before him in the Taharan dy-nasty, King Arth Mockmorrow Koughenough of the leathered leggions, now of parts unknown, (God guard his generous comicsongbook soul!) that put a poached fowl in the poor man’s pot before he took to his pallyass with the weeping eczema for better and worse until he went under the grass quilt on us, never-theless, the year the sugar was scarce, and we to lather and shave and frizzle him, like a bald surging buoy and himself down to three cows that was meat and drink and dogs and washing to him, ’tis good cause we have to remember it, going through summersultryngs of snow and sleet witht the widow Nolan’s goats and the Brownes girls neats anyhow, wait till I tell you, what did he do, poor old Roderick O’Conor Rex, the aus-picious waterproof monarch of all Ireland, when he found him — self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback, owing to the leak of the McCarthy’s mare, in extended order, a tree’s length from the longest way out, down the switchbackward slidder of the land-sown route of Hauburnea’s liveliest vinnage on the brain, the unimportant Parthalonians with the mouldy Firbolgs and the Tuatha de Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he just went heeltapping through the winespilth and weevily popcorks that were kneedeep round his own right royal round rollicking toper’s table, with his old Roderick Ran-dom pullon hat at a Lanty Leary can't on him and Mike Brady’s shirt and Greene’s linnet collarbow and his Ghenter’s gaunts and his Macclefield’s swash and his readymade Reillys and his pan-prestuberian poncho, the body you’d pity him, the way the world is, poor he, the heart of Midleinster and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney’s Dreans of Ergen Adams and thruming through all to himself with diversed tonguesed through his old tears and his ould plaised drawl. starkened by the most regal of belches, like a blurney Cashelmagh crooner that lerking Clare air, the blackberd’s ballad I’ve a terrible errible lot todue todie todue tootorribleday, well, what did he go and do at all, His Most Exuberant Majesty King Roderick 0’Conor but, arrah bedamnbut, he finalised by lowering his woolly throat with the wonderful midnight thirst was on him, as keen as mustard, he could not tell what he did ale, that bothered he was from head to tail, and, wishawishawish, leave it, what the Irish, boys, can do, if he did’nt go, sliggymaglooral reemyround and suck up, sure enough, like a Trojan, in some particular cases with the assistance of his vene-rated tongue, whatever surplus rotgut, sorra much, was left by the lazy lousers of maltknights and beerchurls in the different bot-toms of the various different replenquished drinking utensils left there behind them on the premisses by that whole hogsheaded firkin family, the departed honourable homegoers and other sly- grogging suburbanites, such as it was, fall and fall about, to the brindishing of his charmed life, as toastified by his cheeriubi-cundenances, no matter whether it was chateaubottled Guiness’s or Phoenix brewery stout it was or John Jameson and Sons or Roob Coccola or, for the matter of that, O’Connell’s famous old Dublin ale that he wanted like hell, more that halibut oil or jesuits tea, as a fall back, of several different quantities and quali-ties amounting in all to, I should say, considerably more than the better part of a gill or naggin of imperial dry and liquid measure till, welcome be from us here, till the rising of the morn, till that hen of Kaven’s shows her beaconegg, and Chapwellswendows stain our horyhistoricold and Father MacMichael stamps for aitch o’clerk mess and the Litvian Newestlatter is seen, sold and delivered and all’s set for restart after the silence, like his ancestors to this day after him (that the blazings of their ouldmouldy gods may attend to them we pray!), overopposides the cowery lad in the corner and forenenst the staregaze of the cathering candled, that adornment of his album and folkenfather of familyans, he came acrash a crupper sort of a sate on accomondation and the very boxst in all his composs, whereuponce, behome the fore for cove and trawlers, heave hone, leave lone, Larry’s on the focse and Faugh MacHugh O’Bawlar at the wheel, one to do and one to dare, par by par, a peerless pair, ever here and over there, with his fol the dee oll the doo on the flure of his feats and the feels of the fumes in the wakes of his ears our wineman from Barleyhome he just slumped to throne.
So sailed the stout ship Nansy Hans. From Liff away. For Nattenlaender. As who has come returns. Farvel, farerne! Good-bark, goodbye!

Pink Cheeks,Natalie Buening,"12 ContributorsCOVID Relief Freestyle Lyrics
Oh shit, I guess we're starting
The mic is where my heart is
I know what my part is
I hear my own voice
I make my own choice
I guess, we're fuckin' doing it
The horse is out the gates
It's time to start the race
Shoutout to Kathy Bates and also Betty White
All the people, if you're the type
I wanna say that you're equal on the mic
But nobody's equal to me
Nobody is coming for my neck
I am looking for respect
I'm not looking for a check
Unless it is for my friends
That's why we're doing this
To make some pennies
And maybe make amends
Sailors in the sea might get the bends
That is my fuckin' dream
To go with James Cameron in a submarine
To the bottom of the ocean
Rocking forth with the motion
Me and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion
Sharing our emotion
Daring you to fuck with us
At the sea, at a deep water vent
But we don't got the bends, we're not bent
I think that's what I'm meant to do
Me and my crew
Gigantic, looking to cross the sea
For the Titanic
Oh shit, you mean they found it?
Already? They'd abounded with treasure?
Man, that doesn't give me pleasure
I don't know how to measure
How I feel about that shit
But that won't make me quit
In my quest, to scour the deep sea
Like, you and me?
Searching for an angle, mangled
The corpse in the Bermuda Triangle
Maybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane
We're like ""oh, shit, what remains""
And
Then we get to the bottom
Amelia Earhart's like ""oh, shit, got em!""
You didn't know, but I was an immortal
I just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal
Shuffled off my fucking mortal coil
Mortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil
All my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal
And you know, I am not gonna take a foil
To my head in a little tin cap shape
Because you know I'm great
I popped the grape
But I'm not on some conspiracies
I'm just trying to see what's up in the seas
I believe that I will not cease and desist
You cannot resist
When I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist
I am in Manila, in Hong Kong
In San Francisco, doing a disco
Pop it hot like it's Crisco
But I gotta pace myself
If we're gonna raise this wealth
That's why I flow at this tempo
Hello, I do kempo
In my mind, that's a form of martial arts
But I take, partial starts
And I just gave little partial farts
When I'm shitting on the mic
'Cause you know I got this heart
And you know I got the K-Mart
State-of-the-art mind
But I'm not be-hind
No, I'm way out in the front
Rolling up a 30-foot blunt
And you know I'm not gonna bunt
In a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger
Because I am the rap ringer
I never make the wrong call
And you know, chicks dig the long ball!
I am like (Ah)
They are like (Wow)
Watsky, you cannot stop me
I got no paparazzi
I'm a fucking doorstep
I'm gonna take one more step
And then, take another
Word, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'
Here I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada
Just keep rappin', yada yada yada
Hey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld
Me and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld
Or maybe it's more like Larry David
Because you know we're not playing
Shoutout to the Jews, the chosen people
You know that you cannot fuckin' lose
But also, shoutout to the Christians
Shoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions
You know you cannot stop it
Also, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith
Who know we're gonna make way
For the Jehovah's Witnesses
They got their hit list-esses
Walking up to the different fuckin' doors
Saying ""Would you like to love God a little more?""
But it kinda sucks, just because of COVID
They can't be making no bids
I heard they're not doing that door-knockin'
But, you know, we're not stoppin'
However you appraise 'em
No, we are fuckin' raising
On the mic I'm fuckin' blazing
If the sun is blazing
I turn into a raisin
I'm bringing this whole craze
For almost two whole days
I don't think that's possible
I don't think that's wise
I don't think that's probable
That is what they say when they look in to my eyes
My momma was afraid for me
She busted in like the maître d
She said ""Hello umm""
I don't think you wanna sit here
I don't think you wanna get here
'Cause you might die
You know but then I was like ""I gotta try""
I gotta try to do the right thing
Shoutout to Spike Lee
I'm gonna try to get the ring
Try to get the bling
Try to be the king of the long raps
Like I was the dude with the ass raps
Doesn't matter
As long as the people fuckin' clap
As long as we give a little joy
Give em dat'
Then I will cut the crap
I guess I am a believer
And I don't care that I got seizures
I got my fuckin' pills
I'm gonna take 'em right around midnight
So I can get right
I think that's what I gotta do
Shout out to the medical commun-
Itty I just get gritty
I hope my rhymes are not shitty
Umm, mic check are you with me?
Shout-out Bobby and Whitney
But not shout out to the bad things he did
I don't know if I'm gonna have a kid
I don't know if I'm gonna raise a child
But it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild
They would make be fuckin' smile
They got fuckin' bile and some guts
Everybody does
Everybody got guts
Everybody got nuts
Or half the people maybe like 48.7%
That's about how it went
I think that is the percentage-ish
Of the gender fuckin' separation
Although we know in this nation
Things are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient
If you don't understand
I got my fuckin' rhymes on demand
I can run it back
But I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness
If I'm trying to fuckin' win this
I will not get winded, I have not rescinded
Anything that I've fucking said
By the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead
I'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds
That is like Right Said Fred
You just gotta relax
If you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe
I don't get lyrical cataracts
So I can see clearly, so I can be dearly
Received, I've got to achieve
Whatever I've got up my sleeve
Whatever I've got in my pouch
Shoutout to pouch, ouch
I pricked my finger, that is not true
But on this mic I will linger for you
And for my crew
This is what I've got to do
I've got to drop it hot for you
'Cause this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm not
Shoutout to Mims
Shoutout to Hims
That's that brand of underwear
That I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway
I'm drivin' down the one way
I'm cruisin' up the runway
Spreading my wings
Like I am a Cessna
Like I am a chestnut
Roastin' on an open fire, bing!
Crosby, you got me
Me, hot see?
Me Watsky
See?
Sittin' in the hot seat
No, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat
But that word, beats droppin' me
And meha coppin'
Shoutout to Frank Macoppin
Playground
In the fuckin' San Francisco SFC
Because you know how this go
We are the best in Dolores Park
We have a chorus singin' in the dark
Hark, the angel
Shoutout to Chuck Rangel
Rangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but
In December maybe I will be dismembered
By a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa
Comin' down my chimney
Wavin' fuckin' butcher knives
That’d be fucking crazy
Who is he
Who is this robotic crazy Santa
Oh my ‘lanta
I can’t believe that he’s tryna get me
Instead of giving me presents
I can't believe that he got me on the ground
But I'm like ""no I'm Watsky""
And Santa said ""oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude""
But I'm like ""that's rude
Santa you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'
Plus I was in the nude
He got me tackled on the ground
My fuckin' whole brood around me
And I got my whole butt out
He's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away
Cut-out
Cut it out like on Full House
John Stamos
John Stains-Most in his pants
But that's okay
We don't judge people who like to dance away the day
If they need a Pepto-Bismol
My throat is not abysmal
This all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt
I will not repent
And I’m not demented
But I meant it
When I sent it
From my brain
I'm not plain
Im not fuckin' around
I’m not cluckin' the ground
Just right there it’s only two feet
That’s pretty cool man I eat
From that cup right there
The one that’s floatin' up in the air
It’s got a fuckin' strawber-
-ry smoothie
I flow very smoothly
But you cannot do me
Do me, do me like that
I got that roomie type rap
It’s mad philosophical
I just keep on droppin' all
Of the marbles in my brain
They’re comin' out my nose
And then they just remain
On the ground
Even the cat’s eye
That is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by
Did you know at places
People on the internet watch marble races
I watched one
It was mad fun
I picked the fuckin' blue marble
And my pick wasn't all garbled
It came down the shoot
It was going all fuckin' cool
And then it fuckin scooted past the red one
That kid from The Shining like Red-Rum
Meaning murder
Worder
Wordier
All my flows are so dirtier
Than you could even fuckin' guess
I'm not even fucking stressed
I'm so damn relaxy
Shout out to a Maxi-Pad
For being so absorbent
That's a good fuckin' fuction
My girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it
Put her hands in the air
Maxi Pads doing what they do down there
If you are shaved or if you've got hair
It doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare
Do what you wanna
Word to your mama
Your dude can't tell you what you gotta do
Gotta do what you wanna
Make your own choice
With your body or your voice
If you are moist
I know some people don't like that word
Palabra
But you know you gotta like what you like
There was this one time this dude named Ike
Ran to be Prez
And he fuckin' won
Eisenhower, that's what I said
I's a power-rapper
Yes I am
So fuckin' dapper
The clapper
Doesn't work on the lights on this green screen
Man, that would be a dream scene
If I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want
What I want, damn
That would be no scam
I don't eat no Spam
That's 'cause I am a soft boy
And I only eat Bok-Choy
'Cause I'm a little veggie human
And that's what I be doin'
Let me clarify
Like clarified butter
Again, word to your mother
And also not to digress
But I gotta get it off of my chest
Word to Mark Wahlberg
Word to ballers
Wait, okay, let me make my main point
As I rap over this joint
And that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy
I also eat soy
I also as a Jewish type dude not a goy
Get lots of joy out of eatin' carrots
Out of eatin' broccoli
Out of eatin' lots of trees
Out of smokin' lots of trees
That is true
That is not
I don't smoke a lot
But I do when I party
But during COVID, I party hardly
And I guess that's kinda sad
But I've had some calls with my dad
Paul Watsky
And Claire Watsky
It's rare, stop me
It's not, lots of Sundays
I call my parentals
And I just steal out my fuckin' mentals
But I don't pull out my dentals
I go sometimes I do in a dream
When I am on the scene
And the ghost come and make me scream
It's like you are doing the most
And I gotta fuckin' boast
Shout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast
That is some shit if you take a gander
That was said by Mr. Ned Flanders
Mr. Homer Simpson
I'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on
They're like “Watsky, I'll do everything for you
I'll white knight for you and your fucking crew”
I'm like “Dude, don't be a simp
Actually, DO be a simp
You could be pimp
You could be wimp
You could fucking walk with a limp
You can have a crimp in your dimp-le”
I just get the whole tent pole
Up in the sky cause I meant
Lots of people can come in
Cause I got a big tent
So if you are a lame
Fucking get bent
And by lame, what I mean in this game
Is the type of person who says that you're lame
Is the type of person who judges
Is the type of person who never budges
When they get stubborn
Cause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard
 00:18:04
Word!
I think I got this whole thing turn-ed up
But that is bound to happen
34 hours when you keep on rappin'
Some words are going to collide like trains
Coming head to head, but it remains
To be seen that I get back on the track
With the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*
With my fucking clapping gums
So don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb
Sometimes
Cause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes
But it happens and I think that is the lesson
That you cannot achieve perfection
And it's not even a worthy goal
You just gotta try to put that ball in the hole
More times than not
This is why I'm hot, as I said
But, you know Man's Not Hot?
Although the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am
'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham
On the microphone-o oh no
Can't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno
Ice skatin' all over the beat
Makin' it repeat
I do not want to beat my meat, on the camera
That would be a bad fuckin' PR move
When I'm all up in the groove with my meat out
They would be like ""oh, shout out
That will ruin my career
Is that fuckin' clear?
Showin' his whole rear?
He got fuckin' nakey
Make me, take me
You cannot bake me
In my EZ bake oven
No Sara Lee
I just keep on flowing, so merrily
Verily, forsooth, did he do that shit
Oh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it
He's just Frank Coppin it
And there is no halting' it
I just put some fuckin malt in it
Make it like some Yoo-hoo
Yoo-hoo!
Did you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed
'Cause you could not rhyme
Like I do, do the crime and you know that I'm
Just puttin' lime on top of this shit
And that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me
'Cause you know when I put it on top
That I am going to make it drop
To the bottom of the urinal
You're all in my brain
And I'm hearing y'all
But I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments
I be too scared to see the tools
But I got to just remain bold
And I've got to stay in the hold
My whole nuts life, oh, my nuts
Remember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?
Remember jungle?
You might also like
They got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate
Verbally, vocally, stoking the fire
Of the couress I retired
I feel one year
'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear
See how I could sing, that took many years
Before I try to do with the din
And now I only rapped
And now I only try to cap, no cap
I just try to get that back
That back, uh, back
And I'm gone
Over the fence
No shout out to my pens
You know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda

I'm sittin' on the veranda
Just sippin' on my water
Lookin' at my ink blotter
Feelin' like the best
Starin' at my Rorschach test
And it's tellin' me some dark crap
It's tellin' some star type of stuff
Like oh shit, I'm gruff
I'm like Scruff, Scruff, Scruff, my gruff
Scruff, my gruff, Chicago, Illinois
6-0-6-5-2 that I'm
(00:44:22)
You know that a bat kills
Using sonar
Going through the cave
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
In the sense of my evil
I'm like Evel Knievel
I can jump over three mics
With my tiny little bike
I am gettin' funky
Did you see that video yesterday with the monkey
On the motorbike
That pulled that kid down the street, yeah that little tike
It was really scary
I didn't eat for like three hours, you dared me
To, but I said that that video was too weird
A monkey trying to steal a kid, man, this dude's clear-ly
A weird type of simian
Type of chimpanzee, I don't know which one
It was, it was in Jakarta, I think?
I don't know what type of the rink
Of this world that I skate
I repeat that I'm late
To the party
But that means that partly I gotta go hardy
Hardly, not like Tom Hardy
I don't like smarties
This is a smoothie by the way, I'm hardly
Eating nothing, I say
I say, good sir
Would you like to duel?
I'll trade you a mule
I'll trade you a tool
I'm going to school
Going to university
Facing adversity
You're seein' the worst in me
I am not burstin' the
Seams, like memes
I'm eating ice creams
I'm chasing my dreams
I'm just tryna seem like a normal dude
But I'm not chilly like Hormal, rude
I am in the can
You know it is not a stamp
What we're doing is real, no fake news
I cannot make you
I cannot take you
Being so far away
I just plant the seed like a caraway
Like a fucking sesame
I want to give you more besame's
More besame
You though?
Besame mucho, when this is all over
(00:46:52)
(00:48:16)
Space Jam 2, fucking Pawnstars
(00:48:19)
What do you feel

Man, will it get real?
(00:50:53)
Squidward you had one job
Flipping them burger patties
Rollin' those damn fatties
I wonder what you think
If you try to blink
Man you can just imagine
That you were underground with an fat one
I mean under the ocean rollin' up
Tryin' to light a blunt in the ocean
I don't think that it would light, what emotion
Do you think if you think of Spongebob
Rollin' up under the ground in a pineapple
Under the sea, that is quite snapple  of me
To tell you exactly, you see?
I smell you, I feel you, E-40
Would say that to me if it was not so portly
If he was not better
Oh shit, I accidentally insulted E-40
And I was not on purpose
Lord, forgive me, I did not mean this to do this
It just came out of my mouth then it felt the rudest
Even though he's a hero compared to Ham Amazero
I am like Chalamet to De Niro
Dinero, oh shit, shout out to the kid Nero
And Deezus, they are like verbally Jesus
With lots of great writing, Josh fuckin' Gondol, man
Writing that shit, man, you know he's beyond the man
Remember that movie Joanna, man?
I don't think that it was very good
I think that it was sorta weak
But you know that a type of wood is cherry or tea
And yes, I can speak, I'm a freak
Of the week and my beak
Just keeps flappin' and I keep rappin'
I wonder when the beat change will happen
What I keep snappin'
My fingers, I linger
I bring her a pain
I bring this game
To a whole new level
I use a tool like a bevel
Holla without, I am not a devil
I am not a bowl evil
Shout out to all people
All creative people
But not all have the same struggle
You know life's a thugga
War, some people got more
And that is the weird shit
The way that we're living
We don't wanna give in
To the system we were born in
And I hate to horn in
With my own damn opinions
But I don't think rackin' pinions
Steering is the best, man, I'm clearin' out my chest
Now I gotta give you what I think
I don't think you should wear mink
But I think everybody should wear pink
I think everybody should stay hydrated and take a drink
I think that fucking Joel Santana
Cameron were ahead of their time
Damn, thinking purple

Six ones so I can have big fun
I'm gonna ball on the wall
With the lights pulsing like it is a rave
I am not a knave
I'm a fan
And you all know
And you all go at your own damn speed
It's kinda odd
That I'm flowing the dude who loves all this poetery
Not odd
But his name is girad
Whatever he has I'm sure it's a great bod
And up on the scene in between
I wanna shout out sierra steen
And be so adroit
To remember to shout out alex niece from detroit
A type of weed is harissa or is that a type of spice
Either way I wanna shout out Alyssa and she's really nice
Coughs
Shit I grab this water
I keep on flowin hotter
Hide your wives and your daughters
That’s an og meme man
Inkblotter
I can say a whole mouthful
And that’s me
And I gotta give a shout out to ali
And I'm like goddamn
I give a shoul out to autograph man
And like I gave a shout out to
I just wanna amble
Over to there I don't take a gamble
These are the rarest rhymes I ever spit
This is the rarest three I ever hit
From the middle of the court
Driving down the court in jorts
Oh shit, don't tell Guinness
'Cause I really wanna win-ness
And I really wanna go the distance
All the way to the finish
Shout out to Norwegians and the Finnish
Shout out to dudes who are skittish
And also fucking prudish
I just have a new dish
That I eat everyday for my supper
Shout out to 
I'm like a guppy
Swimming around in his tank
Not a puppy
You cannot stop me
But you see that Watsky has got what it takes
To not pump the brakes
He is not gonna ever
Sever the ties that he's got
He's no Severus Snape
The cleverest ape on the mic
And you know that he likes
And you know that he loves
To do what he can
He's no toucan sam
He leads with his nose but he gives no damn
And he is goin' ham
He has got the slam
Weed, I see that
Fuckin' Jeff has got the vinyls
'Cause I was runnin' out of shit to this, say
Time to get some things to feed my brain
Now he's got the fuckin' vinyls and they will remain on the table
I think I have got to take a little piss break
Shout out to Mugatu from Zoolander
The hammer falls more American 
I am not needy
My mind's not the bearest
Evangeline, Amy Loo Harris
I'm just stayin' alive
Like The Beatles in '65
If I had all the squares I'd hit bingo
John Paul George and Ringo
England's new phenomenal
Pop group, The Beatles, alley oop
Oh shit, like I said
Tchaikovsky and Watsky, I am at the door
Shoutin' out Symphony Number 9 in E Minor
Open 64
I just do my thing, I just am the shit
Shout out to John Chenner's greatest tits
How do you say his name? I don't really know
I'm just tryin' to grow a little more every day
Great tunes, great flows, no rooms
You know I'm ruthless
This is the family library of great music
I keep flowin'
In part because I am inspired by Beethoven
Hello, Nash
That's what Jeff says, man, I got no 
That would be bad, man, I'd fall
Just scratchin' myself, man, but now I stall
I'm talkin' no jive
Just shoutin' out Pablo live
Mary Loo Williams
Take care of yourself
Just do it if you can
Watching is enough

You can just click share o
For how an artist
I'm gonna be frank
I'm not a big fan of hank

A little weirded out
And I really love the
You can leave it there
A taxidermied Iguana XD
This is the coolest gift that I have ever gotten

Now I'm just walking as you hear me talking
Hour Two (1:00:00-1:59:59)
If I was on Facebook then I would poke
Every single one of you, but it's nothing romantic
Shout out to Pacific, to Atlantic
And even the Baltic and the Mediterranean
And I am just an alien
When I'm makin' these rhymes
And I'm feelin' so fine
But it is no crime
And I don't get slime
New beat, turn it up a bit
Let me hear it, I'm just fuckin' with it
And I know that now up on this beat
Max Miller Lauren makin' you move your feet
Got the people buzzin'
Max is my first cousin
Wasn't he in Invisible Inc?
He was, oh, that makes you think
Take a little drink
My other glass clink
I cannot blink
Shout out to Link
From Zelda, Melda
Whole lot of people together held ya
In your arms like the Ocarina
Waka Flocka Flame Ocarina
Ballerina aminda
Keep on going, keep on giving
Keep on living, keep on thriving
On this mic I am surviving
Actually, maybe turn it down at here
'Cause you know I care but
If I rap too loud
I think my voice will go horse
I think my voice will go donkey
I think my voice will go mule
I was just rappin' 'bout high rule
That was the dual wear fuckin' link live that
I just got these big raps
A tiger is a big cat
But I don't give a big crap
Oh shit, he really get that
I don't go tip for tap
I don't hold the grudge
I just keep on droppin', I'm like Harren Judge
He is on the yankees
And I gotta say this frankly
I really miss baseball
And mix all the troubles melt away
But we don't have it on Saturdays
Or Sundays or Mondays or Wednesdays or Tues'
But we just pay our dues
Keep on rockin', keep on rappin' for our crews
Keep on doin' what we can for our friends
'Cause they're gonna be the ones in the end
To hold our hand when everything else melts away
When it all goes dark
You gotta all go back to the people from the ones that you knew at the start
I got a lot of great beats comin'
Goin' and drummin'
From my folks
Crackin' like some yokes
You know that I hope
We're gonna heat, go and drop in this dope
And I never will mope
Evermore like the battle
Forever more Led Zep
Shout out to my dude Shep
He's a real hep cat
Do you fuckin' get that?
He was the best that I ever knew
The best that I ever saw
I'm just droppin' bust, all type rhymes
'Cause you know I gotta do this like I'm
A circular saw when I'm wearin' my Birkin stocks
Used to be that I'd work a lot
Now we work a lot tryna get our tour set up
Again 'cause you know that we got these friends
That are promoters in conserve and you owners
And even the fuckin' stage hens
That y'all make it happen
They gon' make it go
They on, make the gear spin
We're winning together as one
Did you think that this could happen?
Oh shit, I got some fuckin' shoutouts
That I get to really say
But we don't really play
No, we don't do that today
Okay, ouch, ouch, it's the shoutouts
That I gotta give to the Beatrice Teer
So everybody knows that if you wanna go
Get a shoutout, is this too on the nose?
You gotta go to watskyrelief dot com
Where you can drop those financial bombs
Pay us some owns, pays us some respects
And at the ten dollar level you get what's next
That is for meet up, say your name on the stream
 start
Never flippin' the bird
Never droppin' a turd
Never gettin' so scurred
That my vision is blurred
Just to keep goin
Just to keep hoping
Just to keep ropin
All of these cattle
Doing this battle
Good against evil
Never gonna leave
Never gonna be
A dude named Steve
I'm never gonna change the name
I'm gonna change the game
You think you can stop me but you can't
I'm outta control like an ant


Hour Three (2:00:00-2:59:59)
I wonder, I've got this doubt
To my girlfriend I'll shout
Amber, do you think I'm saying ""fuck"" too much on the stream? I'm saying ""fuckin'"" a lot
Did that make 'em scream?
That's cool, say it fuckin' more
Oh curl, oh curl, like Cardi B
I put glow hardly into this dark night, man, I'm saying
Fucking, fucking, fucking, fucking, man, I'm sprayin'
Man, over this concrete
On this fucking dope beat
Oh shit, this is ham
Pin me in, this is the one I begin
To flow easily
This flow is so easy, see
No Eazy-E
You are all pleasing me
It's no
 start
Is the place that I rap
My throat sounds like I got strap
I got a limp in my step
But I don't ever dip
And I don't wear a slip
I gotta keep it up at the same clip
I woke up with a headache
But I still felt pretty relaxed
I knew in a couple hours
 start
Because he was pouring sweat
A whole bunch of pictures
People thought he looked really bad
Looked really sweaty
They didn't elect him
Because he had
A real bad demeanor
And betweener
All of us
That's just politucs
What do we got next?
What's a history lesson in which the people can be blessed?
Looks like a big battleship
I'm not rattled if
That's what you think
I hope you don't blink
I don't know what this is all about
A hairdresser, man, I'm callin' out
And we're the confessor
All upon my dresser
I will not pester you
And I will not tester
There's some boobies in this pic
That's cool, free the nipple, man, that's real slick
Honestly, the male nipple and the female nipple
I don't really get the difference, man, is it that simple?
Why is one obscene?
Why is one unclean?
I guess that's just what we could talk to think
That stinks
This is a dude clean, fucking clear net
I wonder who is it yet
He's in Paris
That's very romantic
They're across the Atlantic
Oh shit, this is the grassy knoll
That's the picture that I hold
That's the day JFK got popped
In its open top car he was shot
When he rolled up in Dallas
And a shooter on the hill has such malice
And he shot him and he died
That was really sad, I know my mom cried
She was in shock 'cause a little child
Man, for the whole nation that must've been wild
And there's RFK
No wait, that's wrong
You know I don't play, that's his son
RFK is here
Kennedy's son is here, man, saluting near to his father
This is the Pope
I think that's right
Gettin' harder, it's dope
Oh that's wrong, it's Irish play ride John OKC
Get all these facts right, man, you can't make me
Being wrong, that's my emo
On this mic I just spit more emo
Will I stop? I just say heck no
Yeah, here is the Pope
I guess that's just the coincidence he was on the next page, that's dope
I'm not at the end of my rope
At my rope I'm at the beginning
On the path to winning
Here's the cover about Uranus
Here's a dude swinging his kids
Around with his arms
I think that's good parenting
I think you gotta let kids do their own harm
And make their own mistakes
Man, you can't treat them a kid, glubs
That would not be great
Not at my best
But that's cool off my chest
Off my mind, can't expect to be perfect
Who just gotta keep it
Moon event, you gotta have, make it
Go, you gotta take it so slow
If you're gonna cross the finish line
If you're gonna get in time
Oh shit, it's the Fab 4
Yeah, The Beatles, that's more incredible
Than you could believe
Look at John Lennon with his crazy fuckin' sleeves
His military shirt, is that Audrey Hepburn?
I think that is, man, I'm no half stepper
What I think that was, the jacket from that campaign
You can't tell me that that's lame
So iconic
Wow, it's demonic
Harry Belafonte? That's incredible
Man, practically edible
Damn, I don't know
Woodstock, should be Hetrix
Who knows? You could blow
Wow, there's a lot of top list stuff in this book
I think that's great, man, that's not rough, look
I would show you if I wouldn't get flagged by YouTube
I'm on my sauce like shoyu, so sauce and you know that
This looks like million
A heart, I could heal one
 start
I have just begun
And I have not yet won
I have not yet stopped
I have not yet ceased
And I am not creased
I am not diseased
I am not leavin'
I have no bee sting on my head
I am just beasting until I'm dead
I make them see red
I have not been bled
Thank you 
Of all my hope
You know I just go and vote with my mind
I also vote absentee
Yeah, actually
I'm still a voter in the San Francisco 415
Prolly will be 'til the day I die
'Cause my mom is up on local politics
You know I gotta want it
You know I gotta put it straight
I got this bee in my bonnet
Me? I am not going to just stop
And drop
And stop-drop-and-roll
That’s what they teach you to do
When you’re on fire to hold
I’m on fire, I’m old
I break the fuckin’ mold
I only spit gold
I only spit cold
Again, I have not been Rick Rolled
Let’s see what the scrabble dictionary got
I hope it’s got some words that’re hot
To put up in my pot
So I can stir them 'til I'm not
Dead
This word is Amboli
I don't know what that means, but it rhymes with holy
No power

I've got what it takes
The next word is jaundice

The next word is jeep
All these fuckin' words, man
I toss 'em in a heap
I'm not allowed to sleep
I would not make a peep
If the sandman came and sprinkled sand dust
In my eye
I would be like
""What the fuck, guy?""
Why'd you sprinkle sleep dust in my eye
That is going to make me stay awake
Man, I try
To go to sleep but this
Goddamn jackass sprinkling sleep dust in my face, man
That is really messed up
It’s the whackest
That does not make me feel jolly
I like Buddy Holly
From Weezer AND the dude
I hope that's not rude
I hope you been brewed
Houston, where they're chopped and screwed
Houston, do we have a problem?
Am I on one?
Man, I'm not gonna go 'til I drop

Some days a feel funky
I'm just a weird monkey
The next word is jubon
Did you buy this book with a coupon?
Did you get your gray poupon?
I'm not somethin' to poop on
So if a pigeon flies up to me outside
I be like ""Man, your wings are how wide?""
And be like ""Aw, not as wide as a condor.""
But if you like me, you can take a gander
Out in gondor with the rings
Where they have the legend and the three kings
Man, I'm still beasting
The next word is kaiser
I am releasing all of my tension
I cannot mention
The next word is Kame
And Kamela, and Kain
The next word is Kanji
Did y'all see Jumanji?
I only saw the first one
I don't know if the next one was the worst one
The next word is Kappa
Y'all remember PaRappa the Rapper?
Dude was cool, he had a beanie kinda like mine
And he had some tight rhymes
Was he a dog or a rat?
I don't remember what animal that dude had
In his genome
Y'all wanna see me home
I just keep goin' and goin' and goin'
Don't quit it
I just hit it this rhythm
And tried to get wid, umm

But no shout out to haliburton
No shoutout to the iron curtain
I gotta mention someday I was in detention
But now I gotta rise and hit true ascension
Get uptop, as high as I can go at the pace that I flow ... Like a horse...
I don't boast or brag, that's not true, I'm a goddamn Stag
You could put me out the stud
And I won't be a dud
I won't rap crud
I won't just give you mud

I wanna say hello to the clientele donating
Man, you're making me glad
You're making me so happy like
Man, I'm like a dad seeing his son hit a homer
Yes, man, I've run over
Like Red Rover
Hour Five (4:00:00-4:59:59)
I'm not a stofer's meal
You can microwave me
You cannot take me out back and give me forty lashes with a wet noodle
The whole kitten caboodle
Once they're coming, bust my chops
But I tell a man that they better stop
Shout out to the lady
Who did Lambchop, she was fuckin' crazy

They saved them all from dying but I'm not lying
It's like Star Wars
I see all these dudes coming through with their lightsabers
They are not makers of dreams
I see that these are going in reverse order to me
Well, this crazy
Hour Six (5:00:00-5:59:59)
The first Disney Channel movie if you were not lazy
And you were fuckin' alive in 1983
You know Tiger Town would've been on your screen
Next in '84, I say
The movie from Disney was Love Leads the Way
And I don't wanna fight
But in '97 Disney made The Northern Lights
And then oh crap
My friend was in this mummy movie on the raps
1997, heaven
You see me in the 7/11
I wanna tell you, I wanna smell you
I wanna fuckin' call 'em and ask for more volume
On the monitor
That would be really great, that would be the thermometer
 start
You just wanna make me on
I think these names are too hard to pronounce
So I'm gonna put them just out
But I appreciate it
That was a good idea
That's quite clear when I'm rappin' this fear
I gotta look and it near
For one I see, weird
All in this together
I think I'll lean back and then I'll just weather
A bit of this beat like this
As it repeats
Until I have to go piss again
Man, when I piss again
I think I could fill up all of Lake Michigan
Or maybe only Lake Erie
But that'll be when you beer me
I could fill up all the Great Lakes
That would be a great tape
I'll set six fuckin' records in one
That would be some great fun
I think that you make one
And the two and then you just try to drum
On your chest like the drummer boy
I just come 'cause the dumbest Doy
Dude is not the rude
Person who stuck a finger in my eye with the toot
I come to the beat
To the rescue and then I just repeat
I won't miscue
I will miss you
I need no tissue
That's not the issue
If you wanna tell me
What to do you got the ring like the Belford human tolls
I'm tryna come bold
With no 
And the bigger the hole
The more that I'm likely to sink it in
I sink it in like the teeth when I'm gettin' the slim
Lead like I am tiger on the green
From the T to the green, man, I'm in
And everywhere in between
I barely hit the fair way
But I can parlay what I need to
'Cause it's not related
When I rack these beats I'm see-through
And my intentions
Did I mention? That were trying to go
For so god... long
That we'll sing a song
That cannot be wrong
I'm here just to rock
But I cannot talk
I cannot stop
Until my jaws locked
Like I've got the mumps
The fuckin' beat bumps
So move your damn rumps
Move your damn

And drain my bone, man, and take it home 
 end


Hour Eleven 
 start
As I roll by
I see the clouds in the sky
Feeling so fly
I am a whole guy
So please hold my beer
As I do something dumb
I be gone to come
This is my  drum
My life is not home drum
I think that is pretty damn exciting
I really love writing
I really love Henning
Flows, shout out to my dude Henning
He's my german promoter
And I think he's doper
Than any other German
Promoter I've ever had
Even though he's the only one, man, I'm not mad
Okay, a couple sips of water
I'm getting hotter, not in the bad way
Just gotta put that away
I could keep on flowing 'til Saturday
I could put the hat away
*Nah, I won't do that*
I could battle my demons and get vertigo
Hope I'm not hurting, yo
Since itself in your mind
But leave that behind
Everything is integral
In life, because I'm pimpin' all
Avenues like I'm the Scarlet Pimpernel
You know that this is swell
I italicize for emphasis
Gettin this, thankyou for these words you spit and put it to my hat because you’re the shit
What we got next here, what are we going to do next here
This next one is diligent
I am not militant
My energy is not really spent
I feel so elegant
My energy's not really spent yet
I got some more in the tank
Fish name is Hank
Feeling fine like candy
Remember when Mandy Moore did her version on that song?
Sure, I don't know, yo, pass the bong
I'm alluring
I am luring a fish straight of its mooring
You wish that you were on the dock
But I clock all of your protests
But I am not going to go test you
Everything I do is not grotesque
You take a mis-cue, cause you know that I miss you
Silicon Valley is where my alley is
San Francisco, but like the tech biz
What the heck is this, all this shiz?
All the companies, non-profitable
But is there really a fucking future here?
I don't man, it's not quite clear
But I'll steer clear of investing in the next best thing
'Cause my money will go out my pockets like rockets
Fly out with a quickness
My fitness is wild
Man, check out my style, my smile
Oh my God -- his dimples -- it's great!
It's the best person ever
Do I sound like Donald Trump yet? Wait
An eternity to pass before you're burning me
This whole class that I know is fucking your degree
Man, don't give me the third degree
My buttocks are so curve-ery, you could not carve it out
Buttocks was the word they left me, so no doubt
I am nonchalant
I keep on going, I just hit the Bron
Are these words coming from the chat?
Wow, that's so cool, crap
You are the selector
I think I am next, or maybe I'm not
Maybe I was next, and now I am the past next
I no flex, it's a surprise coming up blind to your eyes
Shout out to Cool Guys
Shout out to the dual I have arranged with you
In the next morning, meet with your whole crew
10 paces, then turn, then burn our eyes
We smolder as we get older
The bullet travels, it unravels
The space time continuum
It’s like the Matrix, I'm bending over, man
I'm done
Why did I get into this duel with a random fan idk man i got know idea
I'm going ham
I'm on the doorstep of time
I feel your cold fingers on mine
Oh shit that was the grinch
Oh shit, did I flinch?
I have no wish list but to
Inch myself away from death
You know that I got no fucking stress
I'm a replica of myself
I'm just catsing for my help
Feeling like Reptar
Feeling like a rap star
Know when I can rap bars
As I fucking rep hard
Rep hard for the Bay
For the city I gotta save
It's the 415
You come from there, you thrive
And you're feeling alive
But I can't drive up there 'cause I'm stuck here
But I love LA it's been my city for 10 years
I just know where my roots grow
Shout out to Juno
And the planet Pluto
And my boy Budo
And the dude Buddha
You know you could follow him if you really wanna
Maybe even reach nirvana
Reach nirvana with your momma
I don't know
Comma
Like a flow
I don't have much of a beard
This much is quite clear
But I got a couple hairs on my chin
And that's all I really need to win
And I got this little funky soul patch
If I cut it off, will it grow back?
Yeah, probably, but not more
I think I got more on my cheeks
I've grown them for weeks but its uneven
I've got more on one side, it reeks
It sucks more on my left
It’s uneven hair, man, I’m distressed
But that’s okay
Our flaws is what makes us who we are
They’re what make me a superstar
In my own mind, Vaseline
I’m on the scene, I am a queen
Feeling erratic
Give me no static
Shout out to your granny
I wonder if your granny won a grammy
If so, could she hand me that grammy?
I fucking think so
I fucking pimp the mic and I reload
I just take a heat load
Like I am in the oven
Covered in stuffing
I'm like why didn't you put the stuffing inside?
I don't know, it's not for me to decide
They don't let me cook at Thanksgiving
They don't want my gross vegetarian givings
Maybe someone will eat one serving
But nobody wants them, man
It's hurting my soul
One time I made soup
It was dope and swole
One time I made risotto, oh no
I quintoupled the fucking recipe
But no one wanted my cooking, it was the best of me
That's sad
Anyway, we'll go to sleep now
You know I cannot fucking sleep now
I be how I be always, understand
That in these hallways of my mind
My mind is so rubbery
My girlfriend said cover me
And you can discover me
Do you know about topiary
I am so necessary
I cut it like a fancy shrub
Fucking welcome to the club
Gotta give you a clue
You know what I can do
I'm gonna burn it eternal
My cat’s name was Nermal
No, no wait that was Garfield
I'm out in a far field
My mind's feeling far-fetched
You know I have not quit yet
Now I'm feeling vapid
I'm not flowing rapid
You know I just can't hit this joint
And then spit it candid
Or spit in treaties like Candide 
I'm on a horse, this man-steed is so dope
That I got my voice, and I know that I got my choice
And it's stupendous
Tremendous flow, when I bend this dough
For the needs of my friends and the needs of y'all
I just get this all of my chest
My chest is throbbing like Batman and Robin
But I will not be robbing
I will not be lobbing softballs all over the plate
If I ever get to interview a politician - wait
I'm looking for a loophole
I'm just trying 
Get it, too swole
Scolded, scalded, man, you know
Gotta keep it simple
On a lake as I ripple
Feeling my nipple
Flowing to the tempo
Never let this end, no
I'm a real rice bloke
I will not choke
I don't do coke
Well, I did a couple times
I didn't like it
I thought I kinda had to try it
But it wasn't for me and I stopped
Two times - three times? Man, I dropped
Some acid, though, out in Venice
At the Biennale with my dentist
That was fucking cool, man
That was better than some school, man
I furrow my brow vexingly
No witches are hexxing me
I do it to the nth degree
I do it so specially
Cardiac is my speciality
You got no space balls
I could just make all
Of your dreams come true
Give you a harpoon
And a damn balloon
To pop I'm in the navigator
With an alligator
They say ""See you later""
They say ""Meet me later at the pie spot""
Grab some pie and some coffee
All these people get off me
It’s just me, Watsky
But you know that I'm not gonna be pulled
To your dimensions and ambitions
Did I mention that occasionally I get anxiety?
I have no real piety
I don’t know why it’s me in this body, but it is
So I try to be
An okay type of dude in my daily life
In my daily doings, and maybe I
Succeed from time to time and
Do good from rhyme to rhyme
But I am keenly aware that when you see me, you stare
'Cause you're like ""He looks like some dude who might make me cum
Just by looking."" Oh, are you booking me with your eyes?
Are you cucking me? Why are you doing that?
You could rap about yourself in a strange day
Maybe you do every damn day
If so, you should send me the link
And when I’m not rapping for 33 hours straight
I think I’d try to watch you
If you sneeze, I would say “Achoo”
If you fucking fall, I gotchu
I try to get you up with my trust fall
I try to fucking say “Fuck all my doubts
All the dark thoughts”
I try to danish those harlots
I’m out at a used car lot
Singing some dope harmonics
SInging some harmonies
The devil can't be harming me
I got this great fantasy
That I'm on the faculty at my old school
But the school is in high rule
I’m not quite squeamish
I’m just on the scene, shit
Munching and munching
On this flow, I just jump in
All my hair is really bunchin’
And I’m eating my luncheon
Snap back on this velcro
They all say say ""Hell no""
I all say “Elmo:
But I know my elbow is really close
But you still can't bite it
That's a Russian proverb
You know I won't hide it
I won't hide it on my timeline
You know that I'm fine
I'm not dying on the vine
But I need to remind you
To rewind this like the time lapse
I might collapse
I might collate myself into notes
And then go late into that deep dark night
But not gently, man, I won't go
They meant me to go so fiercely
You know you can't pierce me
With your arrows and your slings
You know you can't bring me down
When you see this crown, I will not be drowned
Do it all for pocket change
Do it all and remain
I see some words from the chat
Thank you, man, I heard that
I think I'll get - woah, these are lots of words --
Maybe not, you know that you make me hot
Under the collar, holler for a dollar
Was that Honey Boo Boo? I don't know
You do the math
Who do you think you are?
I came so far
Words from the chat: cucumber
Up my butt, that makes me not slumber
Rip me in half, that would make me laugh
I am not better than John Cena
I no go bigger -- Cena, Mena
Pause, makes me pause, I can’t get ya
I am the supreme, dream team
You know that I mean on the scene
Play a small violin, hell no
I play a small cello
I just grate this cheese
But that was unsubstantiated
I don't know if I did or not
Shout out to Itero 
Shout out ot Jonah Hill

I won't ostracize anyone with weird eyes
Fucking Asian  orange, what rhymes with orange?
You know what rhymes with orange? George
Kind of, it's a slant rhyme
But I gotta dance, I'm happy
What’s hydrophobic? Afraid of water?
You know you go quick into dissing me
Are you saying that water on my lips has been missing me?
Sticking me in the back with these kind of sideways disses
I don't know, man
Water gets kisses from my lips
I'll fucking kiss this straw, and I get this raw
When I get this H2O, me and my duo - partner
Start your car, but you know I'm not a starter
I am not harder than whatever's inside your Larter
You got some hard tack, our crack at this is you know
Rio with the hard pack 
Fucking Mazel Tov
I could knock your nozzle off
Like matzo ball soup
I'm just saying ""Whoop whoop!""
Shout out to Deadpool
I think it really rules
I'm ridonkuous
I drive a Tonka truck
In an increment, it's like sink or swim
I am not a fisherman
But then I just begin
I'm really wildin' all over the place
I need a Tylenol
This is drastic
What the fuck is endoplasmic?
Oof, gotta boof my strawberry smoothie
Up my damn coof
I don't know -- for a booboo hole
What could be that rhymes with coof
Stick in the opposite of my body’s roof
That was rude
Oh shit, man, damnnit
He just wove a damn vocal tapestry
Just clappin' the mic
And do it so laughably
You know I stay on ya
My words in layers like some lasagna
I'm no Flanagan
Irishman doing damn shenanigans
Actually, man, I'm like quarter Irish
On my mom's side, but I just get Eilish
Billie Eilish on the mic, really stylish
Man, I'm batting my eyelids
I play the etude, no attitude
And then I play the prelude
Out of order, I make my own rules
Got a camcorder, it's so cool
I play that mandala
But you know I swallow all of my pride
Popeye is all in my eye
In my grill, eating his goddamn spinach
Why you like that shit so much man, what is this?
I am hella bae
Hella bae'd out, as clear as cellophane
What the hell remains after that shit out on Anza 
Aguirre, a whole damn bonanza
Hear me, I live out on Cabrillo 
I scrub like a brillo pad
It's the texture of my hair
And my next flow is recipe
Y'all really got the best of me
All the quality ingredients
You know that you see me slip
I’m like a bonsai tree. I grow so slow
That I’m on my back, I barely move
When I flow, I am like a kind of lizard
Maybe, I don’t know, which kind -
A baby fucking kimodo?
Do they go slow or do they go real fast?
Ask someone else, I don’t know, I fucking pass
I’m so fucking pure
All my references are so fucking obscure
They're like, ""Damn, you suck more than a fucking vacuum""
That's not true, I fucking thank you
For reminding me that time is now
To do what I do, I'm quite down
You, though, are out there like Pluto
I don't take caloric readings into account
But I am just prehistoric, on some mesozoic era shit
I am very Land Before Time, man, it’s very quipped
Well equipped, like Littlefoot or Petrie
Man I will not razzle you, I'm not dazzled
I don't embezzle funds from these funds, I won't take a dollar
Not a red cent, I won't holler
Man, fuck this breeze comin' through on my knees
I'm Chuck E. Cheese
I got this piranha flow, I got the jump off. man
So Geronimo!
Man, I'm on the way down
But they can't take my crown
With these verbal ballistics, I need these statistics
The elephant in the squad
Is not relevant, man, that's odd
I just rhyme frequently
And I do it with indecency
But I got respect from all where my peers intersect
But I connect with yo on my goddamn Rolodex
Not in my Rolls Royce
I have just got no choice
I'm a cuck
That's not true, try my luck
That's the first thing that I said when the cuck card popped up
I don't watch my girlfriend fuck others
That would be kind of strange for our relationship, ayeee
Don't wanna play that way
It's okay if you do, but that not my thang thang
I brang brang rhymes and I try to sang sang
Get some more protein, you know that I mean
What I seen, I am not a dinkle leaf 
Little type of periwinkle
That was a very poorly constructed rhyme
But you know, fuck, I can find sometimes
I'm behind my mind in my mouth ways
You know I go gray 
I just get all in, I am just fallin'
Sometimes I say ""Fuck it,""
I got a little whack nugget of rhymes
And then I put it to the side
And then I just rewind my mind
And get these rhymes so hectic
When the morning becomes eclectic
Shout out to KCRW
Support your local stations, it won't trouble you
Getting so mega
Buying a ham, bacon, cheese at a bodega
I just gotta say I don't know how to play
The next word in the pile
It really makes me spile
But repugnant is not an easy word to rhyme
So I put it at the top of the rhyme and I'm fine
And I'll need some caffeine in a couple hours
When I'm on the damn scene, but for now
I'm fucking good as hell
Unscrewing my mind, man, you can tell
That is coming off like a relief cap that I just had to doff
I hope you don't scoff if I just seem soft
I feel animated, I feel that I made it -- oh shit!
What we got now? Kush Mody, throwing it down
Can I get just a bit more volume?
I am just callin' em
It feels good to fucking flow the Mody beat
Maybe a little more even? Just a fucking smiggen
I am not a stool pigeon -- that's awesome
Shout out to the DJ, replay
Everything you said, man, I'll relay
All inside of my head
Minding my own business until I am fucking dead
Man, remember Kush Mody, out in Boston
We got lost in the sauce and we did it
Man, we knew each other so long
I can’t even believe that we been so strong
And with Jackson out in the winter
We were like Master Splinter
You remember, we were doing it
We were making that music shit
I'm so proud and glad at how far we've come
And how far we had to run
I'm flipping like an acrobat on the beat
Can you fucking handle that? I will repeat this
It's about connectivity
This is nativity
It's like the young Christ giving me strength
I don't think twice, I just go back
I'm a player, but I don't crush a lot
I just wanna hit the beat a lot
I fucking got to repeat you, I'm useful
But you know that I am full
I'm not just reactive
I'm radioactive
But I am that kid
And I take it back quick
The next word is adultery
Fucking plucked like upholstery 
The beat keeps on thumpin'
Kush mody on the beat keep on bumpin'
The hour gettin' ungodly
Will I keep on going
Probably
I don't wanna create a fiasco
Just because of my wack flow
I wanna keep on goin'
I wanna keep on rowin'

Against and again I ask the mic

But I am not a hoodlum
I keep dropping these good

Flows

Because this changed our whole worlds
No little boys or girls
And maybe wait a bit
Or don't
I don't know
That's your life
Do whatever you want with your time
Because our lives are so bountiful
And we gotta just power through
Live and thank ourselves and our lucky stars
Or wonder where the fuck we are
In the universe
This is so true it hurts
But I'm not a salesman
I'm more a drink and an ale man
Bringing the truth like a mailman
Feeling like a maniac
Flowing like a brainiac
Because you know that the way I rap
Is so goddamn loquacious
That I'm saying it's gracious
When I'm on the mic I say shit
But otherwise I might not like to say
But I can’t just put this damn mic away
I'm in my cubby hole
Hiding out
'Cause you know that my buddy's roll
It's a scout
If the teacher is coming
Playin' hide-go-seek and you know that I'm drummin'
On a melody
Tell me
Fucking Makaveli
Do you smell me
You know I get heli-
Coptered out of my own mind
The doctor proctored my test
But you need not remind me
That this life is cyclical
I’m putty in god’s hands man
My buddy
It's fucking paramount
To get a golden parachute
This life is rare amount of time
But you know that we get the shoot
We're gonna lose and dilute
And leave a weird residue
I don't know
Who are you
All of these night critters
Are giving me real jitters
In the morning I won't eat fritters
I'll probably eat more smoothie
I wonder how much more there is
A lot
It doesn't have much fizz
Although at some point I have to drink the redbull-y
And then you will have to pull me
Up
On my ass from the couch
And I don't know if I doubt
Myself
I just drop these lyrical thesis
Theoretical theses
You know I make theses
Flows
I got no place-
Bo
Boop
And it doesn't make me mad
Shout out to Adam, that's the supper of dead
I'm gettin' all in

It's A Kind Of Magic,West End Orchestra and Singers,"1 ContributorMusiCares Person of the Year Speech LyricsI'm glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground
I should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists
Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that
Lou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like ""Stardust,"" he'd turn it down because it would be too late
He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that
Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude
I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group
They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me
The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it
Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs
Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she  to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about
Oh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here
Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. ""Big River,"" ""I Walk the Line.""

I still ask, ""How high is the water, mama?"" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing
In Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days
Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice
People would say, ""What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?"" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, ""Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs."" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back

The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album
The secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album
These songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music
I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone
For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once

If you sang ""John Henry"" as many times as me -- ""John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.""
If you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written ""How many roads must a man walk down?"" too
Big Bill Broonzy had a song called ""Key to the Highway."" ""I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow."" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write
Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there’s only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61
You'd have written that too if you'd sang ""Key to the Highway"" as much as me
""Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away."" ""I'm sailing away my own true love."" ""Boots of Spanish Leather"" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that
""Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down."" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing ""I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,"" too
I sang a lot of ""come all you"" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. ""Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail."" Or, ""Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.""
""Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again."" ""If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.""
If you sung all these ""come all ye"" songs all the time, you'd be writing, ""Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.""
You'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense
""When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks."" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, ""When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through / Don’t put on any airs / When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.""
All these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary
Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway
Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs
They didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. ""Yakety yak, don't talk back."" ""Charlie Brown is a clown,"" ""Baby I'm a hog for you."" Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs, they were better. ""This Magic Moment."" ""Lonely Avenue."" Save the Last Dance for Me
Those songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs
Ahmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few
There were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day
Merle Haggard didn't even think much of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know . Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- ""Mama Tried,"" ""The Bottle Let Me Down,"" ""I'm a Lonesome Fugitive."" I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing ""The Bottle Let Me Down.""
""Together Again""? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out
Oh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?
Yep. A more gracious way to lament or ""woe is me"" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...
What have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction.  doesn't even matter
""Why me, Lord?"" I would say that to myself
Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving
After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny
Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do
Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, ""Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth."" Think about that the next time you 
Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about
Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called ""Country Road."" Tom was going off in this  interview -- ""But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that.""
Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio
It was called ""I Love."" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions
Now listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing
This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. ""Sunday Morning Coming Down.""
Well, I woke up Sunday morning
Grammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King
Grammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet
Found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall's poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
You say, “Who is that man?”
You try so hard
But you don’t understand
Just what you're gonna say
When you get home
You know something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is

Do you, Mister Jones?
If ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didn't hear it
I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record
In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews,  they've got to look under every stone when it comes to me. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few

But, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it
Traditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: ""Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues."" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true

The other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio
You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, how do you  those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it
Critics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations
""What do you do for a living, man?""
""Oh, I confound expectations.""
You're going to get a job, the man says, ""What do you do?"" ""Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, ""Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you."" Confounding expectations. What does that mean? 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'
The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is ""Stand By Me"" by the Blackwood Brothers. Not ""Stand By Me"" the pop song. No. The real ""Stand By Me.""
The real one goes like this:
When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me
In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me
In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand by me
That's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: ""Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.""
Anyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?
Anyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. . They're all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices
I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously

He was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don't stand a chance
So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called ""Red Hot,"" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life
He did it with style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet
I'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard ""Red Hot."" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day
Yep. A more gracious way to lament or ""woe is me"" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...
I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was
And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called ""Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days."" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying
And I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing
I'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, ""the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.""1Embed"
